       "[\"18, Self-care predictors of metabolic control in NIDDM patients, The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the relationship between self-care behavior and metabolic control is comparable in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) on insulin and not on insulin. We studied 84 NIDDM patients hospitalized for an elective admission in Washington University's Model Demonstration Unit. At admission. patients reported the frequency of exercise. blood glucose monitoring. and meal skipping for the previous 2 wk. Metabolic control over the previous 8-12 wk was determined from glycosylated hemoglobin assays. In cross-sectional analysis controlling for patient sociodemographic and health characteristics. glycosylated hemoglobin levels were positively related to meal skipping (P = 0.0008) and negatively related to the frequency of blood glucose monitoring (P = 0.0025). Self-care behaviors explained 26% of the variance in glycosylated hemoglobin levels in NIDDM patients. Multivariate modeling demonstrated no significant interaction effects between insulin treatment and self-care on metabolic control. In conclusion. these findings support the clinical significance of self-care activities for metabolic control in NIDDM patients. particularly meal skipping and blood glucose monitoring.\",\n",
       " '18, Effects of thromboxane synthesis inhibitor triflusal on renal hemodynamics in microalbuminuric diabetic patients, Triflusal (2-acetoxy-4-trifluormethylbenzoic acid) is a platelet-antiaggregant drug that selectively inhibits thromboxane synthesis with little effect on prostacyclin production. In this study. we evaluated the effect of 5-day administration of 900 mg/day triflusal on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). renal plasma flow (RPF). urinary albumin excretion (UAE). thromboxane B2 (TXB2). 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha). and PGE2 in nine normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with UAE between 30 and 103 micrograms/min. Plasma TXB2 and plasma renin activity (PRA) were also determined. After administration of triflusal. we observed a reduction in microalbuminuria (59 +/- 25 vs. 33 +/- 22 micrograms/min. P less than 0.01). an increase in RPF (648 +/- 119 vs. 722 +/- 134 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2. P less than 0.01). and a reduction in filtration fraction (0.24 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.03. P less than 0.01). Triflusal produced a significant reduction in both plasma TXB2 (130 +/- 39 vs. 52 +/- 32 pg/ml. P less than 0.02) and urine TXB2 (523 +/- 249 vs. 312 +/- 11 pg/min. P less than 0.02). without changes in PRA and UAE of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2. Metabolic control and arterial blood pressure did not change during the study. These results suggest that platelet-antiaggregant therapy can reduce microalbuminuria in diabetic patients. This effect could be mediated by a reduction in the transglomerular hydraulic pressure through a vasodilation of efferent arterioles secondary to renal thromboxane synthesis inhibition.',\n",
       " '6, Ulcerative proctitis in central Sweden 1965-1983. A population-based epidemiological study, Ulcerative proctitis has by tradition been regarded as a subgroup of ulcerative colitis. Population-based epidemiological studies of ulcerative proctitis are. however. virtually nonexistent. In an epidemiological study of inflammatory bowel disease in the Uppsala Health Care Region. 1065 cases of ulcerative proctitis were diagnosed from 1965 through 1983. Males predominated. with the male to female ratio 1.4:1. Annual incidence rates were higher in urban than in rural areas. The annual incidence rates increased threefold from 2.8 per 10(5) to 6.6 per 10(5) during the period. affecting all age groups over 14 years of age. in both urban and rural areas and in both sexes. Differences in temporal trends and certain other epidemiological characteristics between ulcerative proctitis and extensive ulcerative colitis suggest that ulcerative proctitis is a specific disease whose etiology differs from that of extensive ulcerative colitis.',\n",
       " '18, Prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in elderly subjects and their association with obesity and family history of diabetes, The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in elderly subjects and their association with obesity. central obesity. and a family history of diabetes. A representative population sample of 1300 subjects (471 men. 829 women) aged 65-74 yr participated in the study. The participation rate was 71%. The prevalence rates of previously and newly diagnosed NIDDM and IGT. based on a history of diabetes and an oral glucose tolerance test. were 8.7. 7.0. and 17.8% in men and 11.7. 7.1. and 19.1% in women. Thus. 33.8% of men and 37.9% of women had abnormal glucose tolerance according to World Health Organization criteria. Obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 in men and greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 in women) and central obesity (waist-hip ratio greater than or equal to 0.98 in men and greater than or equal to 0.89 in women) doubled the prevalence of IGT or NIDDM. The combination of obesity and a family history of diabetes was associated with a more marked increase in the prevalence of IGT or NIDDM in men than in women. Simultaneous presence of obesity. central obesity. and a family history of diabetes was associated with a threefold increase in the prevalence of IGT or NIDDM (65.4 vs. 24.1% in men. 52.8 vs. 19.6% in women. P less than 0.001). The major risk factors for NIDDM. e.g.. obesity. central fat distribution. and a family history of diabetes. explained 10% of the variance in 2-h glucose values in multiple regression analysis. In conclusion. the prevalence of IGT and NIDDM was high in elderly subjects. Although obesity. central fat distribution. and a family history of diabetes were significantly associated with the increased prevalence of IGT or NIDDM. they explained only a minor proportion of the variance in 2-h glucose values.',\n",
       " '18, Weight gain associated with improved glycemic control in population-based sample of subjects with type I diabetes, Previous studies have suggested that weight gain is an identifiable risk of efforts to lower blood glucose with intensive insulin therapy in type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects. This study examined this relationship in a population-based sample of type I diabetic subjects participating in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy. Four hundred five adults (aged greater than or equal to 21 yr) with type I diabetes. who were diagnosed before age 30 yr. were studied from 1980 to 1982 and in a follow-up examination from 1984 to 1986. Weight gain over the 4-yr interval averaged 1.8 +/- 5.9 kg. Weight gain was significantly associated (r = -0.26. P less than 0.001) with improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin levels; the quartile of subjects with the greatest improvements in glycemic control gained 3.4 kg. whereas the quartile of subjects with the smallest improvements in glycemic control lost 0.6 kg. Weight gain was also correlated with increases in the number of shots of insulin per day and change in the treatment regimen from one type of insulin to a combination of short- and long-acting insulins. These results suggest that weight gain may be an adverse consequence of improved glycemic control. Efforts to better understand the mechanism explaining weight gain and to prevent weight gain are needed.',\n",
       " '18, Effect of captopril on glucose concentration. Possible role of augmented postprandial forearm blood flow, The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of captopril on plasma glucose concentration. The daily profiles of the plasma glucose levels were determined in 12 non-insulin-dependent diabetic normotensive subjects. treated with or without captopril at a dose of 25 mg 3 times/day. Forearm blood flow was also measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Administration of captopril improved the daily profile of the plasma glucose level. Postprandial forearm blood flow was also augmented 2 h after a meal. These results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may improve glucose metabolism in diabetic subjects. possibly through enhancement of blood flow to skeletal muscle.',\n",
       " '23, Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in cats following exposure to infected human bile, The main pancreatic duct epithelium acts as a barrier to the diffusion of molecules from the duct lumen into pancreatic acinar and interstitial tissue. We studied sequential ultrastructural characteristics of the loss of epithelial barrier function in the cat using lanthanum. an electron-opaque tracer. following perfusion of the duct from the tail to the duodenum with infected human bile. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells were found to become permeable to the tracer as early as after 15 min of exposure. Later. there was progressive disintegration of intercellular junctions and epithelial loss. Lanthanum penetrated the duct epithelium exclusively on an intercellular path. Loss of barrier function of the pancreatic duct epithelium was consistently associated with subsequent development of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis. There was no association between the degree of duct epithelial damage and the severity of acute pancreatitis. Both bile and a suspension of bacteria alone were not harmful to the pancreas. Sequential perfusion produced acute pancreatitis only when at first bile and then the bacterial suspension was perfused. A reversed succession of perfusates produced no morphologic alterations. We conclude: (1) Increased tight junction permeability is an early lesion in acute bile-induced pancreatitis: (2) loss of duct epithelial barrier function is important for the initiation but not for the severity of the inflammation; and (3) bile renders duct epithelial intercellular junctions vulnerable to Escherichia coli bacteria.',\n",
       " '6, Noninvasive measurement of portal venous blood flow in patients with cirrhosis: effects of physiological and pharmacological stimuli, The present study aims to evaluate the usefulness of combined pulse Doppler-real-time ultrasonography as a noninvasive method for the measurement of portal blood flow in man. This measurement technique was performed on 12 healthy subjects and 20 patients with portal hypertension. Ten patients (group 1) were evaluated prior to and after ingestion of a standard meal (Ensure Plus) or placebo. In the remaining 10 patients (group 2). the effects of isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg/SL) administration or placebo were studied. In group 1. food intake caused a significant increase of portal blood flow (from 1038 +/- 539 to 1572 +/- 759 ml/min. P less than 0.02); this effect was due to a significant rise in mean blood velocity (from 18.5 +/- 3.7 to 23.9 +/- 3.9 cm/sec. P less than 0.02). In group 2. isosorbide dinitrate significantly reduced portal blood flow (from 985 +/- 491 to 625 +/- 355 ml/min. P less than 0.05); a significant decline of mean blood velocity (from 18.8 +/- 4.5 to 14.5 +/- 2.5 cm/sec. P less than 0.02) was observed. Placebo administration had no significant hemodynamic effects in either group. Our results suggest that Doppler measurements gave accurate noninvasive estimations of portal blood flow and that this technique may be used to monitor physiological and pharmological stimuli in patients with portal hypertension.',\n",
       " '10, Treatment of fulminant hepatic failure with insulin and glucagon. A randomized, controlled trial, Insulin and glucagon are among the therapeutic modalities that have been investigated in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). We have completed a randomized. controlled trial of insulin and glucagon in 38 patients with FHF from either viral or toxin exposure. The control and treatment groups consisted of 21 and 17 patients. respectively. and did not differ significantly in etiology or admission laboratory values. Mortality was not significantly different between control and treatment groups and was 67% and 82%. respectively. Time from randomization to death or discharge was not significantly different between the two groups. Peak levels of alpha-fetoprotein were statistically higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (P less than 0.01). We conclude that even though a type-2 error may exist. the combination of insulin and glucagon is not useful in the treatment of FHF.',\n",
       " '4, A randomized control trial of two cervical spatulas, The sampling efficacy of the Ayre and Rocket cervical spatulas was compared in a randomized controlled trial involving 533 women who were attending a colposcopy clinic either for investigation of cytological abnormality or for review after treatment of CIN. Smears were compared with respect to the presence of cytological abnormality and two types of normal cervical epithelial cells (endocervical and immature metaplastic cells) which are considered indicators of adequate cytological sampling. Smears taken with the Rocket spatula were significantly less likely to contain immature metaplastic cells (95% CI on difference in proportion; 5-30%). but more likely to contain endocervical cells (95% CI 16-36%). No significant difference was found in the proportion of smears containing one or other type of indicator cell or in the yield of abnormal smears. It is concluded that the Rocket spatula offered no advantage when used in these circumstances. This study illustrates how spurious conclusions of sampling efficacy can be drawn if only one type of indicator cell is used as an endpoint.',\n",
       " '4, Effective destruction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 at 100 degrees C using the Semm cold coagulator: 14 years experience, A total of 1628 women with CIN 3 treated with the Semm cold coagulator between 1975 and 1989 was followed primarily by cytology. The standard suitability criteria for ablation were adhered to except that patients were treated at their first visit when the colposcopist expected that the diagnosis would be no worse than CIN 3. Overall 97% of the women were treated at their first visit. In 30 women (2%) the histology was glandular or worse than expected. but 22 of these showed no persistent cervical disease subsequently. Follow-up was achieved for 87% at 10 years. In actuarial terms the primary success rate was 95% at 1 year and 92% at 5 years. it was similar for all age groups. Repeat cold-coagulation for persistent/recurrent CIN 3 was less successful and is not advised. The outcome for 226 pregnancies established after treatment is known. The rates for miscarriage. preterm or operative delivery were not increased. Cold-coagulation of CIN 3 at 100 degrees C as performed by us is as effective as any other treatment and calls into question the need for more expensive practices.',\n",
       " '4, Circulating C1q-binding macromolecules and their relationship to radiographic characteristics of laryngeal cancer, Circulating macromolecules capable of binding the first component of complement (C1qBM) may represent subcellular components of tissue/tumor debris generated from rapidly proliferating invasive disease. Thirty-eight patients were randomly selected from 74 untreated patients with laryngeal cancer on the basis of disease stage and C1qBM levels. C1qBM levels were correlated with computed tomographic evidence of tumor necrosis and/or thyroid cartilage destruction. Results show that patients with stage III/IV disease with tissue necrosis and/or cartilage invasion had demonstrably higher C1qBM levels than did individuals with similarly staged disease with no evidence of these radiographically defined characteristics (120 +/- 81 micrograms/mL vs 18 +/- 15 micrograms/mL); the strongest association was reflected by the area of necrosis within regional lymph metastases. Elevated C1qBM level in patients with stage III/IV laryngeal cancer thus reflects highly aggressive disease. which is less responsive to therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       " '4, 5-year results of cisplatin and fluorouracil infusion in head and neck cancer, As part of the developmental process for the Head and Neck Intergroup trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced resectable head and neck carcinoma. in 1981 the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Philadelphia. Pa. conducted two nonrandomized pilot studies using chemotherapy consisting of three courses of cisplatin and fluorouracil infusion. Chemotherapy was administered prior to surgery in 42 patients (induction) and after surgery in an additional 29 patients (sequential). The populations were roughly comparable with respect to tumor site and stage. Twelve of the 42 patients in the induction group and seven of the 29 in the sequential group are alive and with no evidence of disease at the last reported follow-up. The median survival was 31 months in the sequential group vs 20 months in the induction group. Only two of the 26 patients with less than a complete clinical response following induction chemotherapy are still alive. Twenty-seven of the 42 patients who received induction chemotherapy did not undergo surgery as initially planned. Despite the lack of surgery. at 5 years the survival between the two groups was not significantly different (27% for the induction group vs 23% for the sequential group).',\n",
       " '4, Primary sarcomas of the major salivary glands, Sarcomas arising in the major salivary glands are rare. This article presents the clinicopathologic features of 11 patients with primary sarcomas of the parotid gland (eight men and three women aged 7 to 75 years; mean age. 42 years). The 11 sarcomas were histologically typified as follows: three malignant fibrous histiocytomas and two each of neurosarcomas. rhabdomyosarcomas. fibrosarcomas. and osteosarcomas. Four patients experienced disease recurrences. and seven patients developed metastases. Seven patients died of their sarcomas. with a mean survival time of 30 months. Four patients were alive from 5 to 12 years (one each with angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma. embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. fibrosarcoma. and neurosarcoma). Prognosis correlated with size of the neoplasm. type of sarcoma. and histologic grade. In this respect. salivary gland sarcomas behaved in identical fashion to their soft-tissue counterparts.',\n",
       " '4, Radiotherapy. The mainstay in the treatment of early glottic carcinoma, Early squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis may be effectively treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Controversy exists as to whether radiation therapy effects survival at the expense of vocal function by ultimately requiring more total laryngectomies for salvage of local tumor recurrence. This study reviewed the medical records of 185 patients with T1 or T2. NO invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis treated with primary radiation therapy between 1969 and 1984. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years after completion of therapy. One hundred sixty-one patients met the criteria for local control analysis. Radiation therapy controlled disease in 93% (105 of 113) of patients with T1 lesions and 73% (38 of 48) of those with T2 tumors. Ultimate control of disease for T1 and T2 lesions. including surgical salvage. was 111 (98%) of 113 and 44 (92%) of 48 patients. respectively. The rate of successful surgical salvage was 75% (T1) and 70% (T2). The T2 lesions with impaired vocal cord mobility or anterior commissure disease were identified as being at increased risk for recurrence after primary radiation therapy. Overall voice preservation was 90%. Our data demonstrate that radiation therapy effects disease-free survival rates that are comparable to those produced by surgery. without sacrificing voice. Although a small percentage of patients with selected early glottic lesions may be more effectively treated with primary conservation surgery. these data do not support a change in philosophy concerning primary treatment of early glottic cancer with radiation therapy.',\n",
       " '9, Reconstruction of pediatric larynx and upper trachea with the sternohyoid rotary door flap, The sternohyoid myocutaneous flap. the rotary door flap. is optimally oriented to serve in laryngotracheal reconstruction. It provides immediate. highly vascularized lining and structural support to the augmented airway. Therefore. it is one of the most versatile alternative methods available for surgical reconstruction of the stenosed larynx and trachea. Thirteen of 14 patients who were managed by the rotary door flap technique have been successfully decannulated. The features of the flap and the surgical technique are described with reference to modifications in the pediatric age group.',\n",
       " '7, Primary parotid malignancies. A clinical and pathologic review, One hundred ninety-four patients with primary malignant tumors of the parotid gland who underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic (1970 through 1987) are reviewed. Survival patterns were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method that separated histologic results into three significantly different groups. Survival rate was highest for patients with acinic cell. adenoid cystic. and low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas; intermediate for patients with high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas; and lowest for the remaining six histologic types encountered. Cox multiple linear regression was used to identify patient and tumor characteristics with greatest prognostic significance. In order of decreasing strength. regional metastatic involvement. pain. male gender. grade. stage. and advancing age all demonstrated independent prognostic significance. Fifty-three percent of patients requiring facial nerve sacrifice were asymptomatic at presentation. A high positive correlation was observed between advancing grade and stage.',\n",
       " '9, Noncongenital hereditary hearing loss in children. Prospective documentation, Younger siblings of children with sensorineural hearing loss of possible hereditary cause underwent interval audiologic examination. Seven siblings (in unrelated families) were found to have progressive sensorineural hearing loss despite early audiograms documenting normal hearing levels for age. Continued testing of these children allowed for early identification and intervention. We advocate regular otolaryngologic and audiologic follow-up even after normal audiologic assessments are made for younger siblings of children with documented sensorineural hearing loss. unless a definite nongenetic origin of the hearing loss in the older child is known. Recessive sensorineural hearing loss with onset in infancy or childhood may present with no antecedent family history and with normal behavioral audiograms early in life.',\n",
       " '23, Nasal reconstruction with articulated irradiated rib cartilage, Nasal structural reconstruction is a formidable task in cases where there is loss of support to both the nasal dorsum and tip. A multitude of surgical approaches and materials have been used for the correction of the saddle-nose deformity with varying degrees of success. Articulated irradiated rib cartilage inserted through an external rhinoplasty approach was used to reconstruct nasal deformities in 18 patients over a 6-year period. Simultaneous use of a midline forehead flap to reconstruct the overlying soft tissue was required in four cases. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean. 2.8 years). Results were rewarding in most cases with marked improvement in nasal support and airway. Revision and/or replacement secondary to trauma or warping of the graft was required in four cases. None of the patients exhibited infection. extrusion. or noticeable resorption. A description of the surgical technique. review of all the cases. and recommendation for continued use of this graft material are discussed.',\n",
       " \"4, A simplified diagnostic approach to pheochromocytoma. A review of the literature and report of one institution's experience, Pheochromocytoma is an unusual but potentially devastating tumor. Although a high index of suspicion is necessary. the likelihood of a pheochromocytoma is lower in the absence of the typical symptoms and findings. Nonetheless. screening must be broadened to include patients with a lower risk of the disease. such as those with resistant or labile hypertension who are minimally symptomatic. Extensive diagnostic evaluations should be reserved for those whose clinical or laboratory findings are more suggestive. Symptoms in a group of patients in whom a pheochromocytoma was seriously considered but excluded overlap symptoms in patients with a pheochromocytoma. Certain symptoms are useful: flushing to suggest a non-pheochromocytoma illness; visual symptoms. flank pain. and pallor to suggest that a pheochromocytoma is more likely. Combinations of symptoms can be of value: 2 or more symptoms from the triad of headache. palpitations. and diaphoresis were present in the majority of pheochromocytoma patients. but in a smaller number of non-pheochromocytoma patients. The presence of the entire triad is more specific. but less sensitive. New hypertension. or hypertension associated with unexplained orthostatic hypotension. are suggestive of an underlying pheochromocytoma. Twenty-four-hour urine studies are consistently abnormal in patients with a pheochromocytoma. but are also elevated in a significant proportion of non-pheochromocytoma patients. Values greater then 1.5-2-fold above the upper limit of normal are very suggestive that a pheochromocytoma is present. and warrant a more intensive subsequent evaluation. Imaging studies are reliable in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. and can help to confirm or exclude the disease. Patients with a higher clinical likelihood and any elevated urinary testing. or with a lower clinical likelihood and persistently and/or significantly elevated urinary testing. should have imaging studies performed. This combination of clinical screening. 24-hour urinary testing. and imaging studies is a useful and reliable approach to patients suspected of harboring a pheochromocytoma.\",\n",
       " '4, Automated immunohistochemical estrogen receptor in fixed embedded breast carcinomas, The authors immunohistochemically assessed the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) in formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 68 breast carcinomas by an automated method using Pronase (CalBiochem. La Jolla. CA) predigestion and alkaline phosphatase detection (Method 1). These results were compared with those obtained by an automated peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with DNAse pretreatment of fixed embedded sections (Method 2). with ER immunostain on frozen sections (Method 3). and with biochemical results (dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic [DCC] assay). Compared with the DCC assay. Methods 1. 2. and 3 gave sensitivities of 54%. 25%. and 89%. respectively. The sensitivity for Method 1 was increased to 74% in those cases with DCC results showing greater than 50 fmol/mg protein. These findings indicate that ER immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (as assayed by Method 1) provide useful clinical information when the results are positive. A negative result. especially if surrounding normal elements are not positive. may indicate no receptors. receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg protein. or improper tissue preservation. In the absence of fresh tissue for ER assay by DCC assay or of frozen sections for immunostaining. and with an understanding of its limitations. this method may be useful.',\n",

Their distinction with the use of immunohistochemical methods, Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma can mimic each other both clinically and histologically. To develop criteria useful in resolving problem cases. the authors compared the reactivities of these conditions (nine cases of granulomatous prostatitis and six cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma) with a panel of antibodies to cytokeratin (AE1/3). prostate-specific antigen (PSA). prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). lysozyme. antimacrophage M. and leukocyte common antigen (LCA). In granulomatous prostatitis. histiocytes were not immunoreactive for PAP. PSA. or cytokeratin; however. histiocytes reacted to lysozyme in nine of nine cases. antimacrophage M in seven of nine cases. and LCA in one of nine cases. Tumor cells from all six carcinoma cases reacted with PAP. PSA. and cytokeratin; all failed to react with lysozyme. LCA. and antimacrophage M. The authors conclude that granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated carcinoma can be reliably distinguished with immunohistochemical methods.',\n",
       " '20, Gene rearrangements in the diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia. Guidelines for use based on a multiinstitutional study, The demonstration of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in human lymphoproliferative processes with the use of DNA hybridization has gained great popularity as a sensitive laboratory adjunct to diagnostic hematopathology. The fact that nearly all B- or T-cell malignant lymphomas and leukemias have one or more rearranged antigen receptor genes provides a biologic basis for a diagnostic test. To formally analyze the sensitivity. specificity. and reproducibility of gene rearrangements in the diagnosis of human lymphoproliferative disease. the authors conducted a large. multiinstitutional study. Through a blinded. controlled approach. gene rearrangement analysis of 275 cases was shown to carry a high correlation with conventional phenotyping and histologic diagnosis. with only minor false-positive and false-negative rates. Significantly. no rearrangements were detected in normal lymphoid tissues or carcinomas. sarcomas. or melanomas. In a randomized study of 50 cases. laboratory results showed a high rate of interlaboratory agreement. regardless of the level of previous experience. Furthermore. the reproducibility of interpretation of data (Southern blot autoradiograms) of 192 cases showed high concordance among 11 observers from multiple laboratories. Based on these findings. the authors propose a set of guidelines for interpretation of gene rearrangement analysis that. if carefully followed. renders this a highly reproducible. safe. and accurate addition to the diagnostic regimen for human lymphoproliferative processes.',\n",
       " '4, Ovarian myxoma. A study of two cases with long-term follow-up, Two cases of the so-called ovarian myxoma are reported. One was from a 13-year-old girl who had a 31-year follow-up and no evidence of recurrence. The second case. from a 65-year-old woman. recurred intraperitoneally. 19 years after the surgery. Both tumors were myxoid. with round to stellate cells. Immunohistochemical. electron microscopic (EM). and DNA flow cytometric (FCM) studies were performed on formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissue of the second patient on both the primary tumor and the recurrence. Tumor cells expressed vimentin and were focally positive for desmin and myoglobin. EM findings suggested a fibroblastic differentiation. An aneuploid cell population was present in the recurrent tumor by DNA-FCM studies. Only four other cases of so-called ovarian myxoma were reported to date. and the follow-up does not exceed 18 months. The authors conclude that the presence of aneuploidy and the late recurrence of one of their cases suggest that certain ovarian myxomas might behave like low-grade sarcomas. The histogenesis of this tumor remains unsettled. but similarities were found with myxomas in other locations.',\n",
       " '4, Bone marrow findings after treatment with recombinant human interleukin-3, In a phase I/II study. bone marrow biopsy specimens and aspirates of 20 patients with malignant tumors but normal bone marrow (n = 6). bone marrow failure resulting from chemotherapy (n = 4). myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 5). and aplastic anemia (n = 5) were evaluated before and after patients were treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). This cytokine proved to be an effective hematopoietic growth factor with only mild side effects. The rhIL-3 treatment led to increased overall bone marrow cellularity with trilinear stimulation of hematopoietic cells. except in most patients with aplastic anemia. In all patients. significant eosinophilia and. in some instances. bone marrow fibrosis developed. In addition to the increase in the number of circulating neutrophilic granulocytes. platelets. and reticulocytes. an increase of peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes was observed. The histologic and cytologic findings support the concept that rhIL-3 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. It appears to be a safe and efficient therapeutic modality in patients with bone marrow failure. Additional clinical studies are needed to determine which patients will profit most from rhIL-3 treatment.',\n",
       " '4, Flow cytometric analysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a useful marker for lymphoid precursor cells. In this study. the authors used flow cytometry (FCM) to analyze TdT expression in human hematopoietic malignancies. Cells were fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde. briefly exposed to nonionic detergent. and subsequently labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-TdT antibodies followed by fluorescein-conjugated antimouse IgG and propidium iodide (PI). which was used for the simultaneous analysis of DNA content. Cells from 20 of 22 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). 4 of 7 mixed lineage leukemias. 2 of 21 acute myeloid and myelomonocytic leukemias. 1 of 2 chronic myeloid leukemias in blast crisis. 1 lymphoblastic lymphoma. and 1 thymoma were TdT positive. Cells from 13 nonlymphoblastic lymphomas. 3 myelodysplastic bone marrows. and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 29 normal individuals were negative. An excellent correlation was seen between this assay. the conventional slide immunofluorescence technique. and an enzyme immunoassay method. The FCM assay detected as few as 2% blasts in mixing experiments of TdT-containing leukemic cells with normal peripheral lymphocytes. Furthermore. the combined analysis of TdT and DNA allowed the recognition of aneuploid TdT positive cells in four cases of ALL. The high sensitivity. the quantitative information obtained. and the capability of simultaneously analyzing DNA content make this method of TdT analysis more valuable than conventional techniques.',\n",
       " \"20, Mycobacteremia in acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Rapid diagnosis based on inclusions in the peripheral blood smear, In 16 cases of human immunodeficiency virus-associated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infection. 7 were diagnosed after finding intracytoplasmic negatively staining linear inclusions within histiocytes using Romanowsky-stained bone marrow aspirate smears. Four patients had inclusions within monocytes and neutrophils in the peripheral blood smear. The authors believe these cases represent the first reported examples of MAC inclusions observed within leukocytes in Wright's-stained peripheral blood smears. Inclusions usually were found in the setting of prominent toxic changes in leukocytes such as large Dohle bodies. marked granulation. and vacuolation. These inclusions are characteristic of mycobacteria and can be confirmed by acid fast stains and mycobacteriologic culture. The authors present the clinical and laboratory setting in which identification of inclusions in peripheral blood smears may be a rapid. minimally invasive. and cost-effective method of diagnosing mycobacterial infection.\",\n",
       " '22, A rabbit model for bacteria-induced preterm pregnancy loss, Bacterial infection has been implicated in premature labor in humans. To elucidate mechanisms and potential intervention strategies. we sought to develop a model of infection-induced pregnancy loss in rabbits. On day 21 (70% of gestation). each uterine horn was inoculated hysteroscopically with 0.2 ml containing saline solution of 10(6) cfu Escherichia coli or Bacteroides bivius or Fusobacterium necrophorum. Fetal viability was assessed. Animals were sacrificed at various times or as delivery occurred. Serum progesterone and amniotic fluid prostaglandins were measured. Cultures and histologic sections were prepared. Compared with the saline solution group. E coli and F. necrophorum-inoculated rabbits were significantly more likely to deliver (16 of 16 and six of seven with mean times of 31.9 +/- 10.7 and 28.3 +/- 11.5 hours. respectively for E. coli and F. necrophorum). Positive amniotic fluid cultures for the E. coli group were found in 11 of 12 (92%) and for the F. necrophorum group in three of three cases (100%). Histologic inflammation was seen heavily in both the E. coli and F. necrophorum groups. whereas it was absent in the saline solution group. Inoculation with B. bivius led to a much lower pregnancy loss rate (eight of 32) and less histologic inflammation despite positive uterine cultures in most animals. This model may provide an opportunity to determine mechanisms of clinical or subclinical intraamniotic infection and to test intervention strategies.',\n",
       " '16, The effect of maternal hyperoxia on behavioral activity in growth-retarded human fetuses, Thirteen pregnant women who subsequently were delivered of infants with birth weights less than the 3rd percentile were studied for examination of fetal heart rate and fetal activity patients during maternal administration of oxygen at a concentration of 50% or room air for 2 hours. None of the fetuses was acidotic at birth. Maternal transcutaneous PO2 levels increased from 79 +/- 3 mm Hg to 158 +/- 10 mm Hg for the 2 hours of observation. The results indicated that maternal hyperoxia produced sustained fetal breathing activity that was almost 100% higher than that in room air (analysis of variance. p = 0.024). Gross fetal body movements. fetal heart rate accelerations. and fetal heart rate variability increased significantly with increasing observation time (analysis of variance. p less than 0.01). but were not significantly altered by maternal hyperoxia or room air. We conclude that despite significant change in fetal breathing activity. ultrasonographic observation of fetal behavioral activity during maternal hyperoxia could not be used to differentiate severely growth-retarded from normally grown human fetuses. We speculate that altered fetal heart rate and fetal body movement patterns usually associated with intrauterine growth retardation might be related to altered development of the fetal central nervous system and are not reversible during prolonged maternal administration of oxygen.',\n",
       " '13, Inhibition of spontaneous uterine contractions during the last trimester in pregnant baboons by an oxytocin antagonist, The effect of a potent oxytocin antagonist. produced in our laboratories. on spontaneous uterine contractions in the pregnant baboon was examined. Three types of uterine contractions were studied: immediately after operation. during the nocturnal period. and near or at labor. Bolus intravenous injections of oxytocin antagonist were given and uterine activity was examined +/- 1 hour after the injection. The oxytocin antagonist caused a precipitate decrease (approximately 70%) in contractile force (mean amplitude x frequency) in the first 15 minutes after injection (p less than 0.05); this force diminished to approximately 90% at the end of 1 hour for both nocturnal and labor contractions. In contrast. uterine contractions immediately after operation were diminished by only 60% within 60 minutes after the oxytocin antagonist. These results indicate that the oxytocin antagonist is a potent inhibitor and suggest that oxytocin is a primary regulator of spontaneous nocturnal and labor uterine contractions in the pregnant baboon.',\n",
       " '13, A mechanism leading to reduced lung expansion and lung hypoplasia in fetal sheep during oligohydramnios, Our aim was to determine the mechanism whereby oligohydroamnios causes reduced fetal lung expansion and eventual lung hypoplasia. We studied 20 fetal sheep during 2 to 9 days of oligohydramnios produced by drainage of amniotic and allantoic fluids during the last third of gestation. Oligohydramnios led to a reversible reduction in lung liquid volume of 19.5% within 48 hours. During oligohydramnios tracheal pressure. relative to amniotic pressure. rose by 1.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); pressures also tended to rise in the fetal pleural space and abdomen. relative to amniotic pressure. and to fall in the amniotic sac. Pressure increments. relative to amniotic pressure. which normally occur in the fetal trachea. pleural cavity. and abdomen during nonlabor uterine contractions. were significantly increased by 1.9 to 2.5 mm Hg during oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios increased flexion of the fetal thoracolumbar spine. quantified as a reduction in the ratio of spinal radius of curvature to spine length (0.76 in controls vs 0.40 after oligohydramnios. p less than 0.001). In three sets of twins. only the fetus exposed to oligohydramnios was affected. A similar degree of spinal flexion imposed on normal fetal sheep cadavers increased abdominal (1.6 mm Hg). pleural (1.5 mm Hg). and tracheal (2.0 mm Hg) pressure. and caused a significant reduction in fetal lung expansion. We conclude that oligohydramnios in fetal sheep increases spinal flexion. leading to compression of abdominal contents. upward displacement of the diaphragm. and lung compression. favoring loss of fetal lung liquid. These changes. which are accentuated during nonlabor uterine contractions and are reversible. may lead to pulmonary hypoplasia if prolonged.',\n",
       " \"13, Observations on the cause of oligohydramnios in prolonged pregnancy, There is increasing evidence that implicates reduced amnionic fluid volume as a major determinant of fetal risk in prolonged pregnancy. We sought to determine whether reduced fetal urine production might be associated with oligohydramnios in pregnancies that reach 42 weeks or more. Ultrasonographic measurements of the fetal bladder were obtained every 2 to 5 minutes for 1 hour in 38 gestations verified to be at least 42 weeks. Oligohydramnios was present in eight of the prolonged pregnancies. Similar measurements were performed in 15 normal pregnancies delivered by elective repeat cesarean section between 38 and 40 weeks' gestation. Hourly fetal urine production rates were calculated with sequential bladder volume measurements. The result of this investigation suggest that diminished fetal urine production is associated with oligohydramnios in prolonged pregnancy. The mechanism by which fetal urine production is reduced in prolonged pregnancy remains unknown. A likely possibility is reduced fetal swallowing because of already diminished amnionic fluid volume. the latter a result of placental senescence.\",\n",
       " \"8, At the water's edge: where obstetrics and anesthesia meet, Conflict exists between satisfying the parturient's desire for oral intake and traditional restrictive standards of obstetric and anesthesia departments. Surveys of institutions providing obstetric services reveal greatly varying oral intake policy. There is neither evidence of benefit in withholding fluids nor evidence of risk in allowing them. Prolonged fasting has potential liabilities. Maternal mortality is rare. and anesthesia-related causes are not among the common etiologies. Aspiration is not a significant factor in the modern era. Higher risk for anesthesia morbidity is associated with general anesthesia. particularly difficult intubation. Instead of implicating oral intake as a risk factor for pulmonary aspiration. the literature consistently emphasizes the critical role of properly trained and dedicated obstetric anesthesia personnel. Unless parturients are not candidates for regional anesthesia. a nonparticulate diet should be allowed. Liberal use of regional anesthesia as well as antacid prophylaxis is recommended.\",\n",

The vaginal fluid of the women with bacterial vaginosis contained significantly greater amounts of endotoxin: 0.308 +/- 0.396 versus 0.008 +/- 0.002 endotoxin units/mg vaginal fluid. Endotoxin in vaginal fluid may contribute to the activation of the prostaglandin system. which could provoke premature labor.',\n",
       " '13, Persistent tubal pregnancy, Persistent tubal pregnancy may be manifest by either acute symptoms or a persistent or rising beta-hCG titer following conservative surgery. This condition is a relatively new complication. related to the recent practice of conservative surgical management of tubal pregnancy. Much has been written on the identification and possible therapy for this condition but little is known about its pathophysiology. Eight cases of persistence were studied. as well as three cases of failed conservative procedures. In nine instances. the surgeon had concentrated appropriately on the maximally dilated portion of the tube. which contained the blood clot and aborted products of conception. Unfortunately. the implantation site was located medially. toward the uterus. Ways of avoiding this complication include medial exploration or possibly the use of mesosalpingeal injection of vasopressin. An understanding of the natural history of the pathologic process might also be valuable in the management of cases of \"persistence\" identified solely by a continuing beta-hCG titer.',\n",
       " '4, Prognostic factors in stage IB squamous cervical cancer patients with low risk for recurrence, About one-half of cervical cancer patients whose tumors recur after radical surgery have negative lymph nodes and clear resection margins. We evaluated 95 patients with squamous cell tumors who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy between January 1975 and December 1985 and who were thought to be at low risk for recurrence to see whether other clinical or histopathologic factors were predictive of tumor recurrence. Detailed retrospective record review and complete pathology review were accomplished for each case. The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 89%. Nine patients developed recurrent disease (9.5%). of whom eight died. Several clinical features were evaluated as possible prognostic factors: patient age (P = .26). patient race (P = .60). cervical diameter (P = .24). extent of gross cervical involvement (P = .36). and presence of contact bleeding (P = .82). Histopathologic features were examined: depth of invasion (P = .31). number of mitoses (P = .42). character of the tumor-stromal border (P = .15). histologic differentiation (P = .02). lymph-vascular space invasion (P = .56). and width of tumor (P = .23). Depth of invasion did correlate with increasing tumor width (P less than .001). Once node- and margin-positive patients are excluded. differentiation may be the only feature useful in identifying patients at risk for recurrence. Because almost one-half of our patients had poorly differentiated tumors. sole use of this feature as a criterion for adjuvant therapy would have resulted in overtreatment of low-risk patients.',\n",

SETTING--London general practice. PARTICIPANTS--611 General practice attenders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Scores on a fatigue questionnaire and reasons given for fatigue. RESULTS--10.2% Of men (17/167) and 10.6% of women (47/444) had substantial fatigue for one month or more. Age. occupation. and marital status exerted minor effects. Subjects attributed fatigue equally to physical and non-physical causes. Physical ill health. including viral infection. was associated with more severe fatigue. Women rather than men blamed family responsibilities for their fatigue. The profile of persistent fatigue did not differ from that of short duration. Only one person met criteria for the chronic fatigue syndrome. CONCLUSIONS--Fatigue is a common complaint among general practice attenders and can be severe. Patients may attribute this to physical. psychological. and social stress.',\n",

CA 125 was measured in 21 women receiving cisplatin. etoposide. and Adriamycin for a total of 275 courses of chemotherapy (median eight). Eight of ten patients had elevated pre-therapy CA 125 levels (median 233 U/mL). CA 125 became and/or remained negative in all 20 women with responding or stable disease and was elevated in all nine patients who relapsed. The median level at the time of relapse was 56 U/mL. Levels were elevated before clinical relapse in five of nine patients (56%). Serial CA 125 may aid in the management of women receiving chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.',\n",
       " '12, Bladder training in older women with urinary incontinence: relationship between outcome and changes in urodynamic observations, The purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which bladder training affects urinary incontinence. Urodynamic data and specific urodynamic diagnoses of 108 women with urinary incontinence were compared before and 6 months after treatment with bladder training. Before treatment. 76 women had sphincteric incompetence. 11 had detrusor instability. and 16 had both. After treatment. 33 women no longer fulfilled the urodynamic diagnostic criteria for either sphincter or detrusor dysfunction. Controlling for severity before treatment. the number of incontinent episodes post-treatment was not associated with change in urodynamic diagnosis. Only the first sensation to void. voided volume. compliance. functional urethral length. and flow time showed any significant changes between pre- and post-treatment evaluations; however. none were correlated with change in the number of incontinent episodes. Bladder training does not appear to affect lower tract urodynamic variables or specific urodynamic diagnosis. and it is likely that its mechanism of action reflects adaptive behavioral changes. Physiologic changes not detected with techniques and/or criteria used in this study may still occur.',\n",

DESIGN: Randomized. double-blind. multiple crossover trial with three treatment periods. each consisting of 3 weeks of active drug therapy and 3 weeks of placebo administration. SETTING: Referral-based geriatric practice in a community hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-four patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were included if they had stage 3 to 6 disease (as determined by the Reisberg scale) and had not been taking psychotropic drugs for at least 1 month and if informed consent had been obtained from the patients and their next of kin. INTERVENTIONS: Fifty to 100 mg of THA daily and matched placebo. RESULTS: Of the initial 34 patients 14 experienced liver toxicity and 3 gastrointestinal side effects during the study; however. all 22 who completed the study were able to tolerate at least the minimum dose. For the 22 patients there was no clinically or statistically significant effect of THA on cognition. functional status or behaviour. The results for individual patients showed no subgroup of THA-responsive patients. CONCLUSION: THA has no clinically important benefits in Alzheimer's disease and is associated with appreciable toxic effects.\",\n",
       " '8, Mechanism of bronchodilator effect in chronic airflow limitation, OBJECTIVE: To examine the mechanisms through which two bronchodilators (theophylline and salbutamol) influence dyspnea during daily activities. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with chronic airflow limitation participated in a multiple crossover. randomized. placebo-controlled trial. The effect of theophylline and salbutamol. alone or combined. on pulmonary function and dyspnea during daily activities was examined. Correlations of changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and maximum expiratory pressures (MIPs) (independent variables) and changes in dyspnea score during daily activities (dependent variable) were also examined. RESULTS: The two drugs proved to be beneficial the effects in general were additive rather than synergistic. The drugs improved the FEV1; theophylline significantly improved the MIPs. The correlation between the changes in FEV1 and those in dyspnea score. after adjustment for the changes in MIPs. was 0.55 (p less than 0.001). The correlation between the changes in MIPs and those in dyspnea score. after adjustment for the changes in FEV1. was 0.39 (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in airway calibre and in respiratory muscle strength play an independent and important role in dyspnea during daily activities in patients with chronic airflow limitation. Changes in airway calibre may be of greater importance.',\n",

Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP). This case is significant in that malignant cells were not present on three cytologic examinations of the pleural fluid or multiple pleural biopsies. We also present a review of the published literature on pleural effusions that accumulate bone tracers. We conclude that pleural effusions that accumulate 99mTc-MDP should be considered malignant or secondary to a malignancy and further work-up is essential even if the cytologic exam of the pleural fluid is unremarkable.',\n",

The ligands. 17 B-estradiol-6-carboxymethyloxine-bovine serum albumin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-BSA estradiol) and hydroxyprogesterone hemisuccinate bovine serum albumin tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TMRITC-BSA progesterone). were used in the fluorescent cytochemical method. The findings obtained from the aspirated cells with the use of the fluorescent cytochemical technique were compared with results obtained from the cell population of the same tumor after removal with the use of both the fluorescent cytochemical technique and the biochemical dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. For the needle aspirates. there was 89% concordance for estrogen receptor and 86% concordance for progesterone receptor between biochemical and cytochemical results. A high degree of correlation was also demonstrated between fine-needle aspirates and imprint preparations with the use of the cytochemical technique. This study suggests that the fluorescent cytochemical technique is an effective tool in assessment of estrogen and progesterone receptor content in fine-needle aspirates of primary and metastatic breast cancer. The fluorescent cytochemical technique can be performed easily at community hospitals and is well suited for specimens of insufficient size for biochemical assay.',\n",

Other imaging modalities also failed to show chest or other abnormal findings. Subsequent biopsy of the right gastrocnemius muscle revealed noncaseating granulomas consistent with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. When using 67Ga to evaluate a patient with a FUO. imaging of the extremities should always be included. Also. when abnormal Ga-67 uptake is present in the extremities. sarcoidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis.',\n",

Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment, In this report. we discuss the definition. characteristics. pathophysiology. and treatment of tic disorders with a major emphasis on Tourette syndrome. Although the diagnosis of a tic disorder depends on the presence of motor and/or phonic tic(s). patients with these problems also have a variety of co-morbid features including obsessive-compulsive symptoms. attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. behavioral difficulties. and learning disabilities. Conservative estimates for Tourette syndrome suggest a prevalence rate of 0.1-1.0 per 1000. This syndrome is inherited in a sex-influenced autosomal dominant pattern with either chronic multiple tic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder as alternative phenotypes of the putative gene. Current evidence continues to support a pathophysiologic mechanism involving synaptic neurotransmission. with the dopaminergic system as a primary candidate. Therapeutically. it is essential to clarify whether a patient's problems are related to tics or associated behavioral difficulties. Pharmacotherapy for motor and phonic tics is strictly symptomatic and should be reserved for those with functionally disabling symptoms. A comprehensive individualized treatment program is often required in the care of individuals with tic disorders.\",\n",

Thallium-201 uptake was high (three times the scalp background) in all pathologically confirmed extracranial metastases and moderate (1.6 times scalp background) intracranially. where most biopsy specimens showed gliosis with scattered atypical astrocytes. Technetium-99m-HMPAO uptake was decreased intracranially in the right frontal and parietal lobes which had been irradiated. It was also decreased in one well-encapsulated scalp lesion and high in another scalp mass with less defined borders. Possible mechanisms of tumor uptake of these agents are reviewed.',\n",

Eleven adult patients with small bowel Crohn's disease undergoing elective resection were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. Three. six. and 12 months after surgery the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration were measured. and the disease activity was assessed. All patients were free of active symptoms throughout the study. One year after surgery small bowel radiology was performed in all patients. Radiographic evidence of recurrent macroscopic disease was found in five of the 11 patients. Three months after surgery both alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than before surgery. There was no difference at this time between patients with recurrence and those with no recurrence. In patients with recurrence both alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration significantly increased at six months in comparison with the values at three months (P less than 0.02). Both measurements were significantly higher at six and 12 months in this group of patients than in those with no recurrence and in normal controls (P less than 0.01). At six and 12 months alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was above the upper normal limit in all patients with recurrence. We conclude that fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance is a noninvasive. inexpensive. sensitive marker of asymptomatic recurrence in CD patients who are under regular supervision after surgery.\",\n",

Parameters were initially examined before starting treatment. Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests. lymphoblastogenesis. natural killer (NK) cell activity. and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production were employed to assess immune competence. Each reaction was classified into four or five grades in accordance with intensity; the 5-year survival rate of the patients showing each grade of the immune response was calculated. A correlation between response before treatment and the survival rate was most clearly noted for lymphoblastogenesis. The skin tests and the NK cell activity showed poorer correlations. and no exact correlation was noted between the IL-2 production and the immune response.',\n",

The results were compared with those of the control normal subjects. There was no change in renal function in the patients with mild to moderate jaundice. with total serum bilirubin from 8.0 to 15.1 mg/dl. Increased urinary sodium excretion and decreased free water and negative water clearances were observed in the patients with severe jaundice with total serum bilirubin from 27.0 to 40.4 mg/dl and normal serum albumin. Renal blood flow was normal. but creatinine clearance was decreased. In severely jaundiced patients with serum bilirubin from 30.5 to 40.1 mg/dl and hypoalbuminemia urinary sodium excretion. free water clearance. negative water clearance. renal blood flow and creatinine clearance were decreased. There was salt and water retention in this group. The findings suggest that in severe jaundice there is inhibition of sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. ADH and increased hydraulic conductivity of the collecting tubules possibly contribute to decreased free water clearance. In severely jaundiced patients with hypoalbuminemia this salt losing effect is converted to salt retention by increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium.\",\n",

Two-point analysis with a DNA probe for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1). which maps to Xq13. suggested linkage to the disorder by a lod score of at least 2.60 at a recombination fraction of zero. The disease in this kindred appears to be clinically and genetically distinct from that in previously reported families with X-linked hereditary ataxia or spastic paraparesis. No mapping data are available for inherited X-linked sideroblastic anemia without neurologic abnormalities. However. structural alterations of band Xq13 may be involved in the development of idiopathic acquired sideroblastic anemia. No alterations in the restriction patterns of two X-linked genes involved in erythrocyte formation-i.e.. a DNA-binding protein (GF-1) and 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS)-were detected in DNA from affected males. arguing against a large deletion in either of these candidate genes.',\n",

To determine if these events may be caused by the increased hematocrit value or some direct effect of the recombinant human hormone. 10 transfusion-dependent hemodialysis patients were divided into two groups of five according to their serum ferritin concentration: group A. less than 800 microgram/liter. and group B. greater than 800 micrograms/liter. After a month of placebo administration. recombinant human erythropoietin was given (150 U/kg intravenously thrice weekly) for four months and then stopped for one month. Hematocrit values were maintained at 0.33 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SD) by dose adjustment in group A and at 0.26 +/- 0.02 by thrice weekly phlebotomies in group B. who received a constant dose of erythropoietin. Viscosity increased from subnormal to normal in group A (P less than 0.02) and cerebral blood flow decreased from above normal to normal (P less than 0.02). In group B minor. statistically insignificant. changes in viscosity and reciprocal changes in cerebral blood flow also occurred. There was no change in either group in transcutaneous oxygen tension. Bleeding time decreased toward normal in both groups during recombinant human erythropoietin administration but the changes did not reach statistical significance. Fibrinogen levels were increased in all patients but remained unchanged. No other significant coagulation-related changes were observed. Recombinant erythropoietin in the dosage and schedule of administration described in this study did not lead directly or indirectly to changes likely to precipitate seizures or intravascular thrombosis.',\n",

Clinical and biochemical effects, Since carnitine deficiency has been reported in some patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. we studied the effects of intravenous infusion of L-carnitine or placebo at the end of each dialysis treatment. The trial. which lasted seven months (one month baseline. 6 months treatment) was multicenter. double blind. placebo controlled. and randomized. Eighty-two long-term hemodialysis patients. who were given either carnitine (N = 38) or placebo (N = 44). completed this study. In each group. clinical and biochemical parameters during treatment were compared with baseline values. Intra-dialytic hypotension and muscle cramps were reduced only in the carnitine treated group. while improvement in post-dialysis asthenia was noticed in both carnitine and placebo groups. Maximal oxygen consumption. measured during a progressive work exercise test. improved significantly in the carnitine group (111 +/- 50 ml/min. P less than 0.03) and was unchanged in the placebo group. L-carnitine treatment was associated with a significant drop in pre-dialysis concentrations of serum urea nitrogen. creatinine and phosphorus (means +/- SEM. 101 +/- 4.5 to 84 +/- 3.9. 16.7 +/- 0.67 to 14.7 +/- 0.64. and 6.4 +/- 0.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dl. respectively.

       " '12, Multicenter trial of L-carnitine in maintenance hemodialysis patients. I. Carnitine concentrations and lipid effects, Previous studies have reported conflicting results of carnitine supplementation on plasma lipids in patients with chronic renal failure. We therefore performed a four center. double-blind placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effects of post-hemodialysis intravenous injection of L-carnitine in ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Thirty-eight patients received up to six months of L-carnitine infusions (20 mg/kg) post-dialysis and 44 patients received placebo infusions. In both groups of patients. baseline pre-dialysis plasma and red blood cell total carnitine levels were normal. but pre-dialysis plasma-free carnitine concentrations and free/total ratios were subnormal. and plasma acyl levels were elevated. Post-dialysis plasma free and total carnitine concentrations were also subnormal. Plasma and red blood cell total carnitine levels rose eightfold in carnitine recipients. but were unchanged from baseline in those receiving placebo. There were no significant changes observed in plasma triglycerides. HDL-cholesterol or other lipoprotein parameters in either the carnitine or placebo treated groups. We conclude that carnitine metabolism is altered in uremia. Furthermore. in a randomly-selected hemodialysis population. L-carnitine injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg results in significant increases in blood (and perhaps tissue) carnitine levels. but this is not associated with any major effects on lipid profiles.',\n",
       " '12, L-lactate high-efficiency hemodialysis: hemodynamics, blood gas changes, potassium/phosphorus, and symptoms, Hemodynamic changes were measured during high-efficiency hemodialysis (HEHD) using three dialysis solutions: L-lactate (46 mM). bicarbonate (35 mM + 4 mM acetate). and acetate (39 mM). Cardiac output was determined by changes in thoracic electrical bioimpedance. Although there appeared to be subtle differences in hemodynamic response to L-lactate versus bicarbonate. the blood pressure. cardiac output. and total peripheral resistance were affected less with either of these solutions than with acetate. In particular. neither L-lactate nor bicarbonate HEHD were associated with a change in cardiac output. whereas with acetate HEHD a marked (22%) increase in cardiac output was seen concurrently with a moderate fall in blood pressure and TPR. Both acetate and L-lactate HEHD were associated with hypoxemia. whereas with bicarbonate HEHD the PO2 did not change. With L-lactate HEHD. correction of pH and plasma HCO3 concentrations was delayed but these values were not significantly different from those obtained with bicarbonate HEHD by one hour after dialysis. Potassium removal was comparable with the three dialysis solutions. Phosphorus removal with L-lactate tended to be slightly less than with bicarbonate. but not less than with acetate. Our results suggest that L-lactate (46 mM) dialysis solution may be a suitable alternative to acetate for HEHD. being associated with a hemodynamic profile that is similar to that of bicarbonate and better than that of acetate. Our results further suggest that the hypoxemia associated with the use of acetate dialysis solution is not intrinsic to acetate. but is due either to a low dialysis solution PCO2 level or to accelerated consumption of oxygen during substrate metabolism.',\n",

Frequently. Al and non-Al phosphate binders are co-administered. Unfortunately. calcium citrate (Ca citr). when given with Al-gel. markedly enhances Al absorption. To determine whether calcium acetate (Ca acetate) also augments Al absorption. 10 normal volunteers were each given orally. three-day courses of the following drug combinations dosed four times daily: 1) aluminum hydroxide gel (Al[OH]3) (5 ml) alone; 2) Al[OH]3 (5 ml) plus Ca acetate (1330 mg); 3) Al[OH]3 (5 ml) plus Ca citr (950 mg). A nine day wash-out occurred between each course. Al levels were measured using flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Daily urine Al excretion was measured during a two-day baseline before each course and during each three-day drug course. Plasma Al was obtained during each baseline and drug course. Mean 24-hour Al excretion (micrograms/g creatinine/day) at baseline versus treatment for each combination was: 1) 5.9 +/- 3.2 versus 42.0 +/- 40.7 (mean +/- SD); 2) 5.7 +/- 3.0 versus 40.3 +/- 28.6: 3) 6.3 +/- 3.4 versus 175.8 +/- 103.3. Al excretion was significantly greater with combination 3 than with either 1 or 2 (P less than 0.05). The difference between 1 and 2 was not significant. Plasma Al (micrograms/liter) at baseline versus treatment for each combination was: 1) 5.3 +/- 4.2 versus 8.1 +/- 2.5 (mean +/- SD); 2) 3.1 +/- 2.2 versus 7.3 +/- 2.9; 3) 3.0 +/- 2.3 versus 12.0 +/- 6.1.',\n",

However. soft tissue calcification has been regarded as rare in pediatric renal patients. Following a sudden death due to pulmonary calcinosis in an adolescent after renal transplantation. we retrospectively reviewed clinical. biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients with uremia. on dialysis. or following renal transplantation cared for at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 1983. Soft tissue calcification was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). Forty-three patients (36 percent) had systemic calcinosis (Group A): the most frequent sites of mineral deposition were blood vessels. lung. kidney. myocardium. coronary artery. central nervous system. and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification was uniformly accompanied by deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had small amounts of focal calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue calcification (Group C). By multiple logistic regression analysis. the use of vitamin D or its analogues. the form of vitamin D medication prescribed. the peak calcium x phosphorus product. the age at onset of renal failure. and male sex were jointly associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with dihydrotachysterol and vitamin D2 or D3. The duration of renal failure. peak serum calcium. serum calcium at death. serum phosphorus at death. and primary renal diagnosis. were not statistically associated with calcinosis.',\n",
       " '13, Gene mapping in Alport families with different basement membrane antigenic phenotypes, The present study was undertaken to determine whether differences among Alport kindreds in the antigenic phenotypes of their basement membranes result from defects at distinct genetic loci or from allelic mutations at a single locus. We analyzed linkage of the Alport gene to polymorphic loci on the X chromosome in three families with Alport syndrome. In two of the families. epidermal basement membranes of affected members showed altered immunohistologic reactivity with a discriminating antibody (FNS1) that identified a 26 kD peptide in the NCl domain of basement membrane collagen. In the third family epidermal basement membranes of affected individuals reacted normally with the antibody. The disease gene mapped to the Xq21-q22 region of the long arm of the X chromosome in the two families with altered basement membrane antigenicity and in the family with normal basement membrane antigens. We conclude that Alport syndrome in each of these kindreds arose from allelic mutations at a single genetic locus. although we cannot at this time exclude the possibility that two or more tightly linked genes are involved. As the genes for the known chains of type IV collagen are on chromosome 13. our findings suggest that the Alport gene may encode a new basement membrane collagen chain.',\n",

Total platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were measured by enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay on platelet lysate. and platelet surface-associated IgG and IgM were measured by semiquantitative flow cytometry. IgG and IgM values showed significant correlations between the two measurement methods. Mean platelet surface IgG and total IgG were 3.6 and 4.3 times greater. respectively. in IVDUs than in controls. and platelet IgM was also significantly higher in IVDUs than in controls as measured by both techniques. Although mean platelet immunoglobulin levels were higher in the IVDUs with thrombocytopenia than in IVDUs with normal platelet counts. these differences did not achieve significance. These data show that platelet IgG and IgM levels are increased in IVDU-associated HIV infection and suggest that these increases are not confined to patients manifesting thrombocytopenia. The herein described platelet surface antibody and total platelet antibody measurements appear to be equally useful in studying this patient population. Specific details for generating platelet-associated immunofluorescence units are discussed.',\n",

The median age of these patients was 42 years. 83% were male. 76% became ill between May and July. and 92% reported recent exposures to ticks. Patients resided in or were exposed to ticks in 14 states. including five where ehrlichiosis had not been reported before 1988. Thirty-four patients (85%) were hospitalized. and many had serious complications. including acute respiratory failure (seven patients). encephalopathy (six patients). and acute renal failure (four patients). Pulmonary infiltrates were demonstrated in 14 patients. cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was seen in 10 patients. and elevated levels of serum creatinine were demonstrated in eight patients. Two patients. both of whom had preexisting medical problems. died. Nonhospitalized patients received tetracycline therapy earlier in the course of their illness than hospitalized patients.

       " '10, Beneficial effects of x-irradiation on recovery of lesioned mammalian central nervous tissue, We examined the potential of x-irradiation. at clinical dose levels. to manipulate the cellular constituents and thereby change the consequences of transection injury to adult mammalian central nervous tissue (rat olfactory bulb). Irradiation resulted in reduction or elimination of reactive astrocytes at the site of incision provided that it was delivered within a defined time window postinjury. Under conditions optimal for the elimination of gliosis (15-18 days postinjury). irradiation of severed olfactory bulbs averted some of the degenerative consequences of lesion. We observed that irradiation was accompanied by prevention of tissue degeneration around the site of lesion. structural healing with maintenance of the typical cell lamination. and rescue of some axotomized mitral cells (principal bulb neurons). Thus radiation resulted in partial preservation of normal tissue morphology. It is postulated that intrusive cell populations are generated in response to injury and reactive astrocytes are one such group. Our results suggest that selective elimination of these cells by irradiation enabled some of the regenerative processes that are necessary for full recovery to maintain their courses. The cellular targets of these cells. their modes of intervention in recovery. and the potential role of irradiation as a therapeutic modality for injured central nervous system are discussed.',\n",

The in vivo cytotoxicities of nonspecifically activated lymphocytes and specifically activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were assessed in a modified in vivo neutralization (Winn) assay. Effector cells (10(6)) and 9L tumor cells (10(5] were combined with 10(4) units of rIL-2 and stereotactically implanted into the right frontal centrum semiovale of the Fischer (F344) rat. At 7 and 14 days. additional effector cells (10(6] and rIL-2 (10(4) units) were administered through the same burr hole. Nonspecifically activated splenocytes were lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. both plastic-adherent and nonadherent. whereas specifically activated CTLs were either syngeneic (genetically identical) or allogeneic (genetically dissimilar). Syngeneic CTLs were T lymphocytes from Fischer rats primed in vivo with 9L cells and restimulated in vitro. Allogeneic CTLs were generated by exposing DA rat lymphocytes either to irradiated Fischer lymph node cells or to 9L Fisher tumor cells in vitro. Control groups included rats bearing 9L tumor who were untreated. those who received peripheral (i.p. or s.c.) administration of rIL-2. or those who received syngeneic unstimulated T lymphocytes and rIL-2. For a set of animals given the same inoculum of 9L tumor. significantly improved survival was shown for groups treated with nonadherent or adherent LAK cells (P less than or equal to 0.0003). syngeneic CTLs (P = 0.0327). or allogeneic CTLs (P = 0.0025) over untreated control animals by using Mantel-Haenzel nonparametric logrank equations.

The parents of sixty-three additional patients who had a non-spinal orthopaedic diagnosis (control group) were matched for age and sex with the study group and were given the same interview. Of the patients who had herniation of a lumbar disc and were less than twenty-one years old. 32 per cent had a positive family history for that lesion compared with 7 per cent of the control group. The relative risk of development of herniation of a lumbar disc before the age of twenty-one years is estimated to be approximately five times greater in patients who have a positive family history. The results indicate a familial basis for herniation of a lumbar disc in patients who are less than twenty-one years old.',\n",

A plasmid clone. pHIV2Z. containing the full-length provirus has now been constructed. and virus particles have been obtained upon transfection into COS-1 and H-9 cells. These particles can infect a number of T-cell lines and exert a cytopathic effect on fresh human and macaque peripheral blood lymphocytes. The cloned virus is biologically and morphologically indistinguishable from its parental uncloned strain as shown by restriction enzyme analysis. electron microscopy. and kinetics of infection. However. as shown by radioimmunoprecipitation assays. the cloned virus-infected cells express a full-length gp41 protein as predicted by the nucleotide sequence. whereas the wild-type parental strain expresses a truncated gp33 protein. Both the parental strain and the cloned virus possess a deletion encompassing the end of the nef gene within the U3 region which apparently does not affect their in vitro cytopathic and replicative capacities.',\n",

Six days before surgery. CMCTs were 9.0 ms on the left and 7.8 ms on the right (normal less than 8.0). median F-waves were absent on the left and needle EMG revealed evidence of denervation in the left biceps. Fifteen days after syringopleural shunting at the T7 level. CMCTs had dropped to 6.9 ms on the left and 4.6 ms on the right; the left median F-wave reappeared with a normal latency. Repeat MRI revealed the syrinx to be smaller in diameter. These results suggest that CMCTs measured from magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex may be useful in the diagnosis of post-traumatic syringomyelia. as well as for following such patients postoperatively.',\n",

To test this hypothesis we compared collagen in canine hearts stunned by repeated occlusion with collagen in hearts stunned by a single occlusion. Regional contractile function was equally depressed in both groups: segment shortening at 1 hour after reperfusion averaged 37% +/- 9% versus 32% +/- 9% of preocclusion values in repeated and single occlusion models. respectively. Midmyocardial collagen content was not different in either single occlusion (10.5% +/- 0.4%) or repeated occlusion models (9.5% +/- 0.7%) when compared with nonischemic hearts (8.5 +/- 0.8%). Collagen damage. which was revealed with polarized light microscopy. was seen in 5 of 6 dogs after repeated occlusion but was not apparent after a single occlusion.

To examine the role of PICSO in limiting the consequences of brief ischemia on left ventricular function. we studied the effect of PICSO in nine open-chest anesthetized dogs. PICSO was performed using a pump-inflated. balloon-tipped catheter in the coronary sinus until coronary sinus occlusion pressure reached a plateau (10 +/- 3 seconds). The balloon was then rapidly deflated (2 seconds) and the cycle was repeated. Regional left ventricular function in the ischemic zone was assessed by sonomicrometry. Coronary blood flow was measured with a flow probe around the left anterior descending artery (LAD) proximal to an occluding suture. Measurements were obtained at baseline. during a 3-minute LAD occlusion. and for 10 minutes of reperfusion. In an additional five dogs. this sequence was repeated during an infusion of adenosine at a dose that abolished reactive hyperemia following LAD occlusion. The addition of PICSO beginning 15 minutes prior to ischemia and continuing throughout LAD occlusion and reperfusion did not prevent. reduce. or shorten ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. PICSO uniformly blunted reactive hyperemia during reperfusion. However. PICSO also reduced coronary blood flow during maximal vasodilatation achieved by adenosine infusion prior to LAD occlusion. Therefore. it is likely that PICSO decreases reactive hyperemia due to mechanical factors arising from venous engorgement rather than by reducing the ischemic stimulus causing vasodilation.',\n",

Of the 24 patients with negative aspirate cultures. five had no further treatment. 12 received antibiotics. and six underwent CT drain placement. All these patients survived. There was one false negative aspirate culture. This patient underwent delayed surgical drainage but expired. There were no major complications from CT-guided aspiration. CT-guided aspiration appears to be a safe and reliable method of diagnosing infection in peripancreatic fluid collections.\",\n",
       " '20, Pathology of childhood AIDS, Pathologic lesions in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can be classified into three broad categories: (1) primary lesions related directly to infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (e.g.. in the lymphoreticular system and brain); (2) associated lesions related to direct or indirect sequelae of HIV infection (e.g.. opportunistic infections. lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. and so forth); and (3) lesions of undetermined pathogenesis (e.g.. cardiomyopathy. nephropathy. and so forth). The pathologic features of the various lesions in these three categories are described. Clinical relevance of the pathologic study of AIDS is discussed. Data on perinatal pathology of AIDS is reviewed.',\n",

In the setting of a chronic interstitial pneumonia in a child with lymphocytosis. hyperglobulinemia. and lymphadenopathy or parotid enlargement. the diagnosis is often clinically presumed. At present the diagnosis can be established firmly only by lung biopsy. Models of pathogenesis include nonspecific stimulation of the immune system. HIV-specific stimulation. or synergy between EBV and HIV. Treatment includes oxygen and bronchodilators as needed. The role of zidovudine and of steroids in the management of LIP remains to be determined.',\n",
       " '23, One-stage repair of colovaginal fistula complicating acute diverticulitis, Fourteen patients with colovaginal fistula secondary to sigmoid diverticulitis were seen between 1964 and 1988. Thirteen had undergone prior hysterectomy. Three different operative approaches were used. Three patients were treated with colostomy alone; one died and the fistula persisted in one. Five patients underwent staged procedures. One patient died of complications after the second stage of a planned three-stage procedure. Four patients underwent a two-stage procedure (fistula takedown. colectomy with colostomy and colostomy closure). all with good results. Six patients were treated with one-stage fistula takedown. colectomy and primary anastomosis. without major complication. We advocate this as the procedure of choice and emphasize the following principles of epidemiology and management: 1) colovaginal fistula complicates diverticulitis in elderly women usually following hysterectomy; this association may be a factor in etiology; 2) vaginography is useful in diagnosis; and 3) planned one-stage repair is the best surgical approach.',\n",

We reviewed records of 125 women who were referred because of nonpalpable. suspicious abnormalities on mammogram. which subsequently proved to be cancer. requiring mammographic localization biopsy and subsequent surgery for therapy. We found that 72 (57.6%) had invasive tumors. 15 (12%) showed evidence of microinvasion and 38 (30.4%) were noninvasive. A total of 115 patients had lymphadenectomy as part of their definitive surgery. Nine (12.7%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had between one and 10 malignant nodes on histologic section. None of the patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors were found to have involved nodes. The mammographic abnormalities which led to biopsy in our series were: calcifications in 74 (59.2%) patients. mass lesions in 39 (31.2%). mass lesions with calcifications in 11 (8.8%). and asymmetry in one (0.8%). Of the nine patients with nodal metastases. seven (77.8%) had a mass with or without calcifications as the indication for biopsy. Increasing tumor size was found to correlate with invasive tumors on histopathologic examination and the incidence of lymph node metastases. Thirty-seven (54.4%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had a tumor size greater than 1 cm. Further. seven (77.8%) of the nine lymph node positive patients had tumors between 1 and 3 cm in size. Of note. however. is that two (22.2%) patients with microscopic tumors had involved nodes. The 4-year actuarial survival in patients with infiltrating tumors was 85.2 per cent. while that for patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors was 100 per cent (median follow-up of 20 months).',\n",

During a 5 week period. 49% (58/119) of soldiers receiving doxycycline and 48% (64/134) of soldiers receiving mefloquine reported an episode of diarrhea. Infection with bacterial enteric pathogens was identified in 39% (47/119) of soldiers taking doxycycline and 46% (62/134) of soldiers taking mefloquine. Forty-four percent (59/134) of soldiers receiving mefloquine and 36% (43/119) of soldiers receiving doxycycline were infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). while 9% (12/134) of soldiers receiving mefloquine and 4% of soldiers receiving doxycycline were infected with Campylobacter. Side effects from either medication were minimal. After 5 weeks in Thailand. the percent of non-ETEC strains resistant to greater than or equal to 2 antibiotics increased from 65% (77/119) to 86% (95/111) in soldiers on mefloquine and from 79% (84/106) to 93% (88/95) in soldiers on doxycycline. Doxycycline prophylaxis did not prevent or increase diarrheal disease in soldiers deployed to Thailand where ETEC and other bacterial pathogens are often resistant to tetracyclines.',\n",

In both systems. infectivity was shown to be distinctive for each subspecies. While L. b. panamensis promastigotes from 6-day-old cultures (early stationary phase) were more infective than parasites from any other culture day. L. b. guyanensis and L. b. braziliensis reached maximum infectivity on days 8-10 and day 10 (late stationary phase of growth). respectively. Although maximum infectivity occurred during stationary growth. strict growth phase dependency was not observed. The populations of parasites on these culture days were composed mostly of small. highly motile promastigotes with flagella 2-3 times the length of their cell bodies. These promastigotes resembled the infective forms transmitted by the sand fly vector. A distinct pathological picture characterized the disease caused by the different WHO reference strains for these subspecies in hamsters: L. b. guyanensis developed the most severe lesions. while moderate and inconspicuous lesions were observed when L. b. panamensis and L. b. braziliensis. respectively. constituted the inocula.\",\n",

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exists in high schools and on university campuses. and it presents a real and immediate threat to teenaged Americans who engage in drug abuse and sexual activity. Appropriately targeted educational efforts are needed to limit HIV transmission among adolescents. Most adolescents are aware of the high-risk activities that may lead to HIV transmission. However. only about one third alter their sexual behavior to avoid AIDS. It is important to move beyond imparting knowledge about AIDS transmission and to move toward changing risky behavior. Strategies for AIDS risk reduction in adolescents should be implemented now across the country. Appropriate support and intervention are urgently needed for adolescents at high risk.',\n",

A pair of biopsies were taken from the antrum. the lesser curvature of the middle body. and the greater curvature of the upper body of the stomach. The quantitative assessment of H. pylori was made based on smear. culture. and tissue section. The histological severity of gastritis was assessed as to the degrees of mononuclear cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. A positive correlation was confirmed between the number of H. pylori and the severity of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. The degrees of inflammatory cells infiltration in the specimens with H. pylori colonization were significantly lower in the upper body than in the antrum.',\n",

Five months to 15 yr (mean 57 months) after the operation. endoscopic finding of the interposed colon was macroscopically normal in 28 patients. Signs of inflammation. including hyperemia or hyperemia and friability. were observed in seven patients. Histologic specimens obtained at endoscopy were examined microscopically. and the findings were compared with those seen in the preoperative graft. In two patients. chronic inflammatory changes were observed in the graft mucosa. consisting of mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria accompanied by crypt dilatation and deformation. In one of these patients. the inflammation was in the proximal third of the graft. and it was also seen at the endoscopy. In the remaining 34 patients. the graft mucosa was microscopically comparable to normal. The alterations were unexpectedly few and mild considering the marked change in the location and function of the colonic segment.',\n",

We studied 22 consecutive patients referred to an esophageal diagnostic center for evaluation of noncardiac chest pain or dysphagia having high amplitude esophageal contractions. 14 of whom completed the study. Diltiazem (60-90 mg qid) was compared with placebo. each being administered for 8 wk. Patients were evaluated with esophageal motility pre- and posttreatment periods and with regular symptom assessment throughout each 8-wk treatment. Active diltiazem therapy resulted in significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean distal esophageal peristaltic pressure (128 +/- 20 mm Hg; +/- SE) than placebo (158 +/- 16 mm Hg). Mean chest pains scores were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower with diltiazem therapy than with placebo. Only nine of the 14 patients fulfilled presently acceptable criteria for diagnosing nutcracker esophagus. and the diltiazem effect was similar. although not significant. because of the smaller sample. Conclusions: In this preliminary study involving 14 patients. the oral calcium channel blocker. diltiazem. appeared to improve noncardiac chest pain associated with strong esophageal contraction. the nutcracker esophagus. These improved symptoms were associated with significant decreases in contraction pressure.',\n",

Seventy-seven patients had mitral valve prolapse. 27 had coronary artery disease. 13 patients had rheumatic mitral valve lesions and 5 patients had infective endocarditis. Forty-eight patients received the flexible Duran ring. 46 received the more rigid Carpentier ring and 28 patients received no ring. Doppler echocardiography demonstrated a significant decrease in mitral valve area estimated by the pressure half-time method in patients who received either a Carpentier (2.6 +/- 0.8 cm2) or Duran ring (2.8 +/- 0.8 cm2) when compared with patients who received no ring (3.2 +/- 0.7 cm2) (p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed for peak transmitral diastolic velocity. peak transmitral diastolic gradient. or the grade of mitral regurgitation by color flow Doppler mapping between patients with and without rings. The etiology of mitral disease and concomitant surgical procedures accompanying mitral valve repair did not significantly influence mitral valve area. peak velocity or peak gradient. These data suggest that Carpentier and Duran rings decrease the hemodynamic mitral valve area; however. the decrease in valve area is small and not associated with a clinically important increase in transvalvular gradient.',\n",

The efficacy and safety of 2 doses of sotalol (320 and 640 mg/day. divided in 2 doses) were compared to placebo in a 6-week randomized. double-blind. multicenter study of 114 patients with chronic ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) at frequencies of greater than or equal to 30/hour. Sotalol significantly reduced VPCs in patients receiving both low (n = 38) and high (n = 39) doses. compared with patients (n = 37) receiving placebo (by 75 and 88%. respectively. vs 10%; p less than 0.001. sotalol vs placebo; p less than 0.05. high vs low dose). The individual efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC reduction) was achieved in 34% of low-dose and 71% of high-dose sotalol versus 6% of placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.003. sotalol vs placebo; p = 0.007. high vs low dose). Repetitive beats were suppressed 25% by placebo (difference not significant). 80% by low-dose (p less than 0.003) and 78% by high-dose sotalol (p less than 0.005). Sotalol decreased heart rate (by 24 to 25%. p less than 0.001) and increased PR (by 4 to 6%. p less than 0.001) and corrected JT intervals (by 12 to 13%. p less than 0.001). but did not change ejection fraction. Proarrhythmia (nonfatal) occurred in 3 sotalol and in 2 placebo patients. Nine discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (1 low dose and 8 high dose. p less than 0.02). In summary. sotalol is an efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for VPC suppression; in lower doses. it is somewhat less effective but better tolerated.',\n",
       " '23, Characteristics of accessory pathways exhibiting decremental conduction, The prevalence. electrophysiologic characteristics and functional significance of decremental conduction over an accessory pathway were examined in this retrospective study of 653 patients who had an accessory pathway demonstrated at electrophysiologic study. Decremental conduction was identified in 50 patients (7.6%). In 15 patients with anterograde decremental conduction. the accessory pathway was right parietal or septal in 14 patients and left parietal in 1 patient. In the 40 patients with retrograde decrement. the accessory pathway was left parietal in 19. posteroseptal in 13. right parietal in 2 and right anteroseptal in 6 patients. Anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 11 of the 40 patients with retrograde decrement. Retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 9 patients with anterograde decrement. There was no significant difference in the accessory pathway effective refractory period. or shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction over the accessory pathway in anterograde and retrograde directions. The shortest RR interval in atrial fibrillation between 2 preexcited QRS complexes was longer in patients with anterograde decremental conduction than in a control group of patients with anterograde-conducting accessory pathways without decremental properties. These data demonstrate that decremental conduction over accessory pathways is uncommon. Anterograde decremental conduction usually occurs in right-sided or septal pathways that often do not conduct in the retrograde direction.',\n",

The study recorded changes in fasting plasma lipids. total cholesterol. high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. triglycerides. and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After establishing baseline lipid/lipoprotein levels in a 3-week period during which all participants received the currently marketed formulation. the men were randomized into 2 groups. 1 group (n = 31) taking the new Questran Light formulation of 4 g of cholestyramine in 5 g of powder per pack. while the other group (n = 30) continued to take the marketed Questran formulation of 4 g of cholestyramine in 9 g of powder per pack. Each group consumed a total of 24 g/day of cholestyramine in 2 divided doses. At the end of the maintenance phase of the study there were no statistically significant mean changes in percentage from baseline to end-point lipid/lipoprotein levels within either group. nor were there any significant differences between the Questran Light group or the currently marketed Questran formulation group. The new low-calorie cholestyramine formulation appears to be equally as effective in maintaining lowered plasma cholesterol levels as the currently marketed formulation.',\n",

One hundred six patients with 119 ostial branch stenoses were compared with 1.168 patients who underwent angioplasty of nonostial branch stenoses. An ostial branch stenosis was defined as a stenosis in the proximal 3 mm of a major branch vessel (diagonal [n = 58]. posterior descending [n = 21]. obtuse marginal [n = 34] and intermediate [n = 6]). The ostial branch stenosis was isolated in 61% of the patients and associated with a bifurcation stenosis in 39%. Despite a balloon to artery ratio of 1.05:1. angiographic success was 74% of ostial branch stenoses versus 91% of nonostial stenoses (p less than 0.01). Furthermore. angioplasty of ostial branch stenoses resulted in a complication rate of 13 versus 5% for angioplasty of nonostial branch stenoses (p less than 0.01). Therefore. angioplasty of ostial branch stenoses results in decreased procedural success and significant residual stenosis despite adequate balloon sizing. suggesting arterial elastic recoil and a significant increase in complications.',\n",

Fatal outcomes. however. represent less than 1% of injury events and thus provide a limited characterization of the problem. Future epidemiologic study resulting in injury prevention depends upon the development of morbidity-based injury surveillance systems. \"E-coded\" hospital discharge data bases (used to indicate external cause of injury) are a valuable source of information for monitoring and controlling serious. nonfatal injuries. An E-coded injury discharge data base was developed and evaluated at The Children\\'s Hospital of Alabama in Birmingham. In addition to patient demographics. length of stay. total charge. and method of payment. E-code and \"N-code\" (to indicate the anatomic site of injury) data were collected.

       " '21, Left ventricular size, mass and function in relation to the duration and quantity of heavy drinking in alcoholics, Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and mild dysfunction are frequently observed in alcoholics but little is known about how they relate to the duration and severity of alcohol abuse. LV size. mass and function were studied using echocardiography and systolic time intervals in 78 middle-aged male alcoholics who also gave detailed accounts of the duration of heavy drinking. the quantity of recent ethanol consumption and the duration of abstinence. Compared with 34 healthy nonalcoholics. alcoholics had a higher LV mass index (85 +/- 2 [mean +/- standard error] vs 77 +/- 2 g/m2. p = 0.001). a thicker posterior wall (11 +/- 0.2 vs 10 +/- 0.2 mm. p = 0.02). a longer end-systolic diameter index (18 +/- 0.3 vs 17 +/- 0.3 mm/m2. p = 0.02). and a higher preejection period/ejection time ratio (0.36 +/- 0.01 vs 0.33 +/- 0.01. p = 0.002). In multivariate linear regression models. these abnormalities proved independent of the drinking history. except that posterior wall thickness was weakly related to the duration of heavy drinking (standardized correlation coefficient 0.36. p = 0.01). Univariate analyses suggested that the LV mass index and systolic time interval ratio had. if anything. a curvilinear relation to the total duration of heavy alcohol consumption. It is concluded that the LV hypertrophy and dysfunction found in alcoholics are poorly related to the duration and severity of self-reported alcohol abuse. Together with other data. this suggests that there is no simple linear dose-injury relation in the long-term cardiotoxicity of ethanol. Factors modifying the myocardial effects of ethanol need to be studies more in the future.',\n",

       " '12, Pharmacology of antiandrogens and value of combining androgen suppression with antiandrogen therapy, Antiandrogens are compounds able to block the effect of androgens directly on their target cells by inhibiting their binding to the androgen receptor (AR). Two chemical classes of antiandrogens are presently on the market or in clinical trials: steroids (cyproterone. megestrol acetates). and nonsteroids (flutamide. nilutamide). Steroid antiandrogens interact not only with AR but also with progestin and glucocorticoid receptors and thus give rise to progestin and glucocorticoid effects. By contrast. nonsteroid antiandrogens interact only with AR and are thus devoid of other hormonal or antihormonal activities. Nilutamide does not need to be transformed into an active metabolite. unlike flutamide. and interacts with dog. rat. and human prostate AR in vitro. Its kinetics lead to a prolonged interaction with AR in vivo after administration to rats. In prostate cancer treatment. it is necessary to combine an antiandrogen to surgical or chemical (estrogens. LH-RH agonists) castration to obtain a complete suppression of androgens. The antiandrogen will block specifically. at the target site. the trophic effect of adrenal androgens left intact by castration. and the secretion of which can only be suppressed by treatments (adrenalectomy. aminoglutethimide. ketoconazole) that also suppress corticoid synthesis. We have shown that nilutamide counteracts the trophic effect. on the prostate of castrated rats. of adrenal androgens administered continuously (minipumps) at circulating levels similar to those recorded in castrated men. Nilutamide will also impede the flare-up effect of the testosterone increase induced by LH-RH agonists at the beginning of treatment. We have shown in the rat treated with buserelin that the increase in prostate weight observed during the initial days of treatment by the LH-RH agonist can be inhibited by a combined treatment with nilutamide. This combined treatment \"nilutamide plus castration\" has been tested in an experimental androgen-dependent cancer model. the Shionogi tumor. The administration of nilutamide to mice. castrated twenty-four hours before the inoculation of tumor cells. delayed the appearance of tumors and reduced their number. Finally. the absence of androgen effect and the antiandrogen activity of the product were also demonstrated in human tumor cells in culture (T-47 D cells) transfected with the MMTV androgen-dependent promoter coupled with the CAT reporter gene.',\n",

       " '12, Castration plus nilutamide vs castration plus placebo in advanced prostate cancer. A review, Combination of antiandrogen treatment with surgical or medical castration should improve the efficacy of endocrine treatment of prostatic cancer by blocking the effects of adrenal androgens. A nonsteroidal antiandrogen. nilutamide. has shown promising results in preliminary open studies. In a short-term (29 days) comparison of nilutamide plus buserelin and buserelin plus placebo. nilutamide (300 mg/day). significantly reduced bone pain. and fewer patients experienced worsening pain than in the control group. The initial buserelin-induced increase in prostatic acid phosphatase was prevented by nilutamide. but there was a similar increase in testosterone and gonadotropin concentrations to that seen in the control group. Thus. nilutamide can prevent the tumor flare-up associated with the start of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) treatment. even though the endocrine responses are not affected. In three multicenter. randomized. double-blind placebo-controlled trials of castration and nilutamide involving 248 patients. the combination of nilutamide and castration decreased bone pain. improved performance status. and increased the number of patients with objective regression. compared with patients who were castrated but did not receive nilutamide. Nilutamide was generally well tolerated. though visual disorders. gastrointestinal disorders. and alcohol intolerance were reported in patients receiving nilutamide.

IGF-II mRNA is expressed at high levels in the adrenal cortex before birth but it is not detectable until after birth in the adrenal medulla. Neuroblastoma cell lines corresponding to early adrenal medullary precursors did not express IGF-II. although all three cell lines we tested were growth stimulated by IGF-II. Cell lines corresponding to more mature adrenal medullary cells expressed IGF-II. and one. SK-N-AS. grows by an IGF-II autocrine mechanism (J. Clin. Invest. 84:829-839) El-Badry. Romanus. Helman. Cooper. Rechler. and Israel. 1989. An examination of human neuroblastoma tumor tissues for IGF-II gene expression using in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that IGF-II is expressed by tumor cells in only 5 of 21 neuroblastomas. but is detectable in cells of nonmalignant tissues including adrenal cortical cells. stromal fibroblasts. and eosinophils in all 21 tumors. These findings indicate that IGF-II may function as an autocrine growth factor for some neuroblastomas and as a paracrine growth factor for others. They suggest that the growth regulatory pathways utilized by neuroblastoma mimic those used in the precursor cell type from which individual tumors arise.',\n",

Current and future status, Etoposide (VP-16-213) is an antineoplastic agent with demonstrated efficacy against a broad spectrum of human malignancies. including testicular. germ cell. lung. and other cancers. Etoposide can be synergistic with other agents. As part of combination chemotherapy. etoposide has become a so-called standard in therapies for testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer. Its activity in tumors such as lymphoma and leukemia. as well as solid tumors. identifies etoposide as a highly important chemotherapeutic agent. Cellular and animal models have shown that the cell kill and tumor response depend on both dose and time of exposure. Recent clinical studies again show that dose and schedule of etoposide can have important effects on clinical response to the drug. Further research should now continue: (1) on the use of etoposide as part of initial therapy in several cancers. and (2) in higher doses and prolonged schedules to optimize this agent's potential.\",\n",

Neutrophil (PMNL) phagocytic and microbicidal functions against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans blastoconidia were therefore evaluated. Bacterial phagocytosis and bactericidal activity were significantly enhanced by approximately 50%-70% after preincubation of normal PMNL with G-CSF in concentrations of 1000-4000 units/ml for 10 min at 37 degrees C. G-CSF in similar concentrations enhanced the defective bactericidal activity of PMNL from HIV-1-infected patients by approximately 70%-150% and reached the baseline control PMNL killing. However. G-CSF enhanced neither phagocytosis nor fungicidal activity of normal PMNL against C. albicans blastoconidia. These data demonstrate that G-CSF enhances the antibacterial but not the antifungal activities of human PMNL in vitro and also improves the defective PMNL bactericidal activity of HIV-1-infected patients.',\n",

In mice myelosuppressed by cyclophosphamide. subcutaneously administered rmGM-CSF was a potent stimulus of granulopoiesis by increasing the number of GM-CSF-responsive precursor cells in bone marrow followed by a profound neutrophilia. Neutrophil recovery was augmented by rmGM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner at daily doses of 0.6-5.0 micrograms/mouse. In addition. rmGM-CSF increased the functional activity of circulating neutrophils at similar doses. When rmGM-CSF was administered to neutropenic mice before experimentally induced Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus. or Candida albicans infections. it protected against these lethal infections. resulting in increased numbers of survivors. These data suggest that rmGM-CSF protects neutropenic mice from lethal infections. probably by augmenting neutrophil recovery after myelosuppression and activation of mature cells.',\n",

In such circumstances. postexposure administration of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine; AZT) might be beneficial. To test this possibility. the SCID-hu mouse (the immunodeficient C.B-17 scid/scid mouse engrafted with human hematolymphoid organs) was treated with AZT at different times after intravenous infection with a standard dose of HIV (known to infect 100% of animals). If given within 2 h. AZT suppressed infection in all animals; if given after 2 days. no suppression was observed. At least in some animals. an AZT-sensitive phase lasted for as long as 36 h. These data support the hypothesis that prompt administration of AZT might be efficacious in suppressing acute HIV infection in humans. Further studies in the SCID-hu mouse might provide insight into treatment protocols of even greater efficacy.\",\n",

Correction of the diminished secretory response in genetically mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice by bone marrow transplantation, To investigate the role of mast cells in transport abnormalities during intestinal anaphylaxis. we examined responses to antigen in isolated intestinal preparations from ovalbumin-sensitized genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv (W/Wv) mice and congenic normal WBBGF1(-)+/+ (+/+) mice. Changes in ion transport (primarily secretion of chloride ions) were indicated by increases in short-circuit current (Isc). In tissues from +/+ mice. antigen caused increases in Isc which were significantly inhibited by antagonists to histamine (diphenhydramine) and serotonin (ketanserin). by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (piroxicam) and by a neurotoxin (tetrodotoxin). In preparations from W/Wv mice. antigen-stimulated responses were approximately 30% of that in +/+ mice and were inhibited only by piroxicam. Responses to electrical transmural stimulation of nerves were approximately 50% in W/Wv versus +/+ mice. and were inhibited by antagonists of mast cell mediators in +/+ but not W/Wv mice. Reconstitution of mast cells in W/Wv mice by intravenous injection of +/+ bone marrow cells restored the normal responses to both antigen and nerve stimulation. Our results indicate that mast cell-dependent mechanisms are primarily responsible for the ion secretion associated with intestinal anaphylaxis. but that other cells are also involved. In addition. our data provide evidence for the functional importance of bidirectional communication between nerves and mast cells in the regulation of ion transport in the gastrointestinal tract.',\n",

A practical approach to antibiotic decision-making involves comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each group of antibiotics available while remembering the patient population being treated and the common pathogens encountered in one's practice. It is helpful to study the penicillin derivatives in approximately chronologic order of development and the cephalosporins in terms of generations because this puts the use of each individual agent in perspective. Familiarity with commonly encountered adverse antibiotic reactions. dosage guidelines. and special situations (pregnancy. pediatric patients) will help avoid problems associated with antibiotic use.

It compares the outcome of treatment with empirically administered amiodarone with the outcome of treatment with other antiarrhythmic agents guided by electrophysiologic testing or Holter recording. or both. The goal of therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing is to suppress inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF. Holter recording is used as the primary means of adjusting therapy only if patients are noninducible at the baseline electrophysiologic study. Patients are stratified according to cardiac diagnosis. ejection fraction. and whether they had previously received an antiarrhythmic agent that failed to suppress their arrhythmias. The primary end point of the study is total cardiac mortality. The first patient was enrolled in a pilot study on April 26. 1984. By October 1988. 142 patients had been enrolled in the full study and. as of May 1990. 199 patients have been enrolled.

       " '14, Relation of cardiac output at rest and during exercise to age in essential hypertension, It has been suggested that the decline of cardiac output with age is due to increased prevalence of disease. particularly occult coronary artery disease. Therefore. the relation of cardiac output (direct oxygen Fick method) to age was analyzed in 110 sixteen- to 64-year-old men with World Health Organization stage I or II essential hypertension at the time of the hemodynamic study. who were alive and free of cardiovascular complications 7 years later. At supine and seated rest. during upright bicycle exercise at 50 W and and at peak work load. cardiac output was inversely (p less than 0.01) related to age. These relations were independent of weight and mean intraarterial pressure. Stroke volume decreased with advancing age at supine rest. but not at rest and during exercise in the seated position. Heart rate was not affected by age in the supine position. but was slower in older patients during upright rest and at peak exercise. In conclusion. in patients with essential hypertension who remained free of cardiovascular complications for 7 years. cardiac output was independently and inversely related to age at various levels of activity. These findings suggest that occult cardiovascular disease does not explain the decline in cardiac output with age in patients with essential hypertension.',\n",
       " '14, Future directions in vasodilator therapy for heart failure, Vasodilator therapy has become a major pharmacologic approach for improving left ventricular function. and consequently. vasodilator drugs are being used increasingly in the treatment of heart failure. Ideally. vasodilator drugs used in the long-term management of heart failure should show clearly defined pharmacodynamic effects. These include reduced impedance to left ventricular ejection. increased venous capacitance. increased left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced heart size. absence of neurohormonal stimulation. and slowed progression of left ventricular dysfunction. The mechanisms of action and sites of activity of the various vasodilator drugs currently available vary considerably. and none as yet has proved ideal for the treatment of heart failure or hypertension. The complexity surrounding the multiple vasoconstrictor mechanisms involved in heart failure has led to a rationale for combined vasodilator therapy and certain combinations are discussed. From a therapeutic standpoint. the development of drugs with multiple mechanisms of action is particularly attractive. Flosequinan is a new vasodilator agent whose cellular mechanism of action remains uncertain. Flosequinan has the advantage of being able to relax both arterial and venous beds and as such may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of heart failure.',\n",

Contrast ventriculography was performed 1 to 4 days after AMI and repeated 5 weeks later. Wall motion was analyzed by the centerline method in the central infarct. peripheral infarct and noninfarct regions. In patients with ventriculographic data at the early catheterization. streptokinase-treated patients had less severe hypokinesia in the central infarct region than control patients (-2.9 +/- 0.9 [n = 29] vs -3.4 +/- 0.7 standard deviations below normal [n = 21]. p less than 0.05). The benefit of streptokinase was more marked in the peripheral infarct region (-1.5 +/- 0.7 vs -2.1 +/- 0.6. p less than 0.001). As a result. the ejection fraction was slightly higher in treated versus control groups (46 +/- 10 vs 43 +/- 7%. respectively; difference not significant). At 5 weeks. function in the streptokinase and control groups had diverged further because of continued improvement in the streptokinase-treated patients. This study shows that streptokinase benefits left ventricular (LV) function by 1 to 4 days after AMI. earlier than previously reported. The benefit was not limited to the peripheral infarct region. where ischemia might have been less severe. but was also seen in the central infarct region. The implication is that thrombolytic therapy can improve LV function during the period of myocardial stunning. while myocardial function is still recovering.',\n",

Patients with positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes per 24 hours were included in this study. Administration of all chronic antiischemic medications except beta blockers were discontinued. During the first week all patients received placebo twice daily. During the second and third weeks. 41 patients received nisoldipine 10 mg and 41 patients received placebo twice daily. In the placebo group there were no changes in exercise parameters or in ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters.

Among the ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters in the nisoldipine group. only the number of episodes was reduced. from 14.4 to 11.6 (p = 0.0013) per patient. There was no significant reduction in total ischemic time (132 vs 120 minutes per patient). No significant side effects were observed. This is the largest clinical trial to date on the effects of nisoldipine on myocardial ischemia.

Successful deployment and positioning were achieved in 55 of 56 patients. Occlusion of the stent was documented in 8 patients. the earliest occurring 30 minutes and the latest 8 months after implantation. Three of the occluded stents were recanalized by PTCA. Coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) were required in 4 patients: 1 for symptomatic restenosis. 1 for left main stenosis adjacent to the stent and 2 for acute ischemia during the in-hospital stay (less than 7 days). Myocardial infarction occurred in the territory of the stented vessel in 8 patients. Seven patients died between 1 day and 19 months after implantation. Local bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients. with 5 requiring blood transfusion. Restenosis within the stent was angiographically documented in 5 patients (9%). A new lesion in the treated vessel was found in 10 patients. followed by implantation of a second stent in 5 and a third stent in 1 patient. Medical treatment was instituted in the remaining 4 patients. Forty-nine patients (88%) are alive. Twenty-nine patients (51%) remained asymptomatic. and 44 (78%) are in a better functional class than before the implantation. Eleven of 15 (79%) major complications (acute occlusions or deaths) occurred in patients who received a stent in the left anterior descending coronary artery.

Biopsies of nasal septum and lung revealed small vessel leukocytoclastic angiitis while renal biopsy showed a diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Immunosuppressive therapy resulted in remission of clinical symptoms and resolution of glomerulonephritis as documented in a followup biopsy.

In all 8 patients there was a high proportion of activated SF T cells. together with an increased proportion of CD2+CD3- and the presence of CD3+CD4-CD8-WT31- lymphocytes. The functional analysis at the clonal level in 5 patients (427 clones) showed a relevant proportion of cytotoxic T cell clones. which were not confined to typically cytolytic phenotypes. but were also present among CD3+CD4+CD8- cultures. Compared to those with pauciarticular JRA. patients with polyarticular disease had a significantly higher proportion of T cell clones with cytotoxic activity. Although derived from a limited number of patients. our data suggest a direct involvement of T cells in the pathogenetic mechanisms that originate and maintain the articular damage. and the possibility of different or more pronounced T cell reactivities in the clinically more diffuse JRA types.',\n",

Mitogen stimulation led to similar proportionate increases in proliferation and immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion in cultures of patient and control lymphocytes. While there was no increase in proliferation. IgG secretion was increased in the absence of mitogen. Nonmitogen activated Ig synthesis could be reduced by replacing culture medium with fresh medium after 16-20 h in culture. It was partly reconstituted by addition of recombinant cytokines. interleukin (IL). IL-2. IL-4. or IL-6. Our results suggest there may be a population of B circulating B cells in patients with JRA and other rheumatic diseases which is sufficiently mature to differentiate and secrete Ig in response to cytokines alone.',\n",

DNA preparations were extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes from 59 patients with SLE and from 166 healthy persons. and digested by restriction enzymes. They were hybridized with C4 complementary DNA by the Southern blotting method and the deletion of C4A gene was judged from restriction fragment length polymorphism. At the same time phenotypic C4A deficiency (C4AQ0) was measured. Our results showed that the frequency of phenotypic C4A deficiency was 44.1% in Japanese patients with SLE and this value was comparable with that (43.2%) in Caucasian patients. On the other hand the deletion of C4A gene was not found in Japanese patients with SLE (0%). or in healthy controls (0.6%). Our results indicate that C4AQ0 may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE beyond the ethnical differences but Japanese patients with SLE have a different genetic background from Caucasian patients with the C4A gene deleted.',\n",

To determine factors that might contribute to postpartum infections following antibiotic prophylaxis. we cultured amniotic fluid. decidua. and chorioamniotic membrane specimens for anaerobic and facultative bacteria and for genital mycoplasmas at cesarean delivery. Women were assessed daily for the development of infections. and if endometritis developed. a protected endometrial culture was obtained. Postpartum endometritis developed in 16 and wound infection in four of 102 women. Infection rates were similar for women receiving cefotetan (N = 50) or cefoxitin (N = 52) for prophylaxis. The isolation of group B streptococcus (P less than .001) or Enterococcus faecalis (P = .03) from the upper genital tract at delivery was significantly associated with postpartum endometritis. Antibiotic-resistant organisms (other than enterococci) were recovered uncommonly at delivery or with postpartum infections. Group B streptococcus was susceptible to the prophylactic agents used. suggesting that virulence factors other than antibiotic resistance are important for the development of postpartum endometritis. Group B streptococcus. E faecalis. and bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis were recovered from the endometrium at the time of postpartum endometritis.',\n",

Two hundred forty-eight women undergoing low transverse cesarean through a Pfannenstiel skin incision were assigned to one of two groups: peritoneum open (N = 127) or peritoneum closed (N = 121). The mean (+/- SEM) surgical time in the open group (48.1 +/- 1.2 minutes) was significantly less than for the closed group (53.2 +/- 1.4 minutes) (P less than .005). There were no postoperative differences between the groups in the incidence of wound infection. dehiscence. endometritis. ileus. and length of hospital stay. Our study suggests that leaving the parietal peritoneum unsutured is an acceptable way to manage patients at cesarean delivery.',\n",

With both. optimum results are dependent on meticulous preparation. technical excellence. and operator proficiency. It is a mistake to place colonoscopy and the barium enema in competitive positions; the two methods ideally complement one another in the evaluation of high risk individuals. including those with positive Hemoccult tests. The exclusion of significant pathology by the double-contrast enema can be relied on and is less costly to the patient. Detection of abnormalities by a barium enema should. when necessary. be followed by colonoscopic verification and/or biopsy. When used in this sequence. the procedures provide a cost-effective approach to the early detection and control of cancer; it is estimated that observance of the ACS guidelines can reduce mortality rates by 30%.',\n",

Nicardipine (1 and 3 micrograms/dl forearm tissue/min in both absence and presence of propranolol) increased forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography) and antagonized dose dependently the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine. suggesting that functional alpha-antagonism may participate in the vasodilating and possibly the antihypertensive effect of the drug. On the contrary. no antagonism but rather potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine occurred after diltiazem (0.5 and 1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min). Because intra-arterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action of the drug. whereas the local vasodilation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced. diltiazem probably interfered with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium entry blockers in humans.',\n",

       " '12, Effect of polycations on the function of the isolated perfused rat kidney, 1. In minimal change nephrotic syndrome the occurrence of heavy proteinuria can be explained on the basis of a reduction in charge selectivity of the glomerular filtration barrier. and it has been proposed that this might be caused by the neutralization of anionic groups by a circulating polycationic factor. 2. The effects of two polycations. protamine and poly-L-lysine. on the function of the isolated perfused rat kidney have been examined. 3. Poly-L-lysine polymers of relatively high molecular weight (8800 and 17.800) induced heavy proteinuria. while simultaneously causing a marked increase in renal vascular resistance and a fall in filtration rate. Protamine (approximate molecular weight 7000) at relatively high concentration induced modest proteinuria in the absence of effects on vascular resistance or filtration rate. 4. A poly-L-lysine polymer of lower molecular weight (3800) did not induce proteinuria. Protamine at a concentration of 40 micrograms/ml and below did not affect protein excretion either. Both provoked substantial natriuresis. This appeared to be largely due to an effect on the tubular handling of sodium since the filtration rate remained steady while fractional sodium excretion rose markedly. 5. The natriuretic effect of protamine was blocked by heparin. but not by indomethacin or verapamil. suggesting that the mechanism of natriuresis did not depend upon either prostaglandin production or entry of calcium through verapamil-sensitive channels.',\n",

The gastrocnemius muscle of seven patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure and of five healthy control subjects was studied using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Spectra were collected at rest and during an incremental. symptom-limited. exercise protocol. Blood flow was measured in the same study during brief interruptions to exercise. 2. The phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine plus inorganic phosphate) ratio was lower in patients with heart failure than in control subjects at an exercise rate of 1.5 W. although intracellular pH and blood flow were similar. 3. The cytosolic free adenosine 5'-diphosphate concentration was markedly increased in patients with heart failure exercising at 1.5 W compared with control subjects exercising at the same workload. 4. Although the maximum workload achieved by patients with heart failure was less than half of that reached by control subjects. the pH and the phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine plus inorganic phosphate) ratio were lower in patients with heart failure at maximal load. Blood flow was less at maximal exercise in patients with heart failure than in control subjects in keeping with the reduced work load. 5. The phosphocreatine depletion induced in the gastrocnemius muscle by exercise was more severe than previously described in the forearm of patients with heart failure. 6. Metabolic abnormalities in skeletal muscle may contribute to exercise intolerance in heart failure. particularly during submaximal exercise.\",\n",

We have studied the effect of inhibiting the interaction of platelet-activating factor with its receptor by using two structurally different antagonists BN-52021 (1 mg/kg. intraperitoneally) and alprazolam (1 and 5 mg/kg. intraperitoneally) on the evolution of glomerular filtration and renal blood flow. in the experimental model of acute renal failure induced by the intramuscular injection of glycerol in rats. 2. We have also measured arteriovenous differences in platelet-activating factor concentration. as well as platelet-activating factor content in glomeruli from rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure. 3. After glycerol injection. untreated rats showed a marked reduction in inulin clearance which reached 77% in the first 30 min. The reduction was only 27% in the rats treated with BN-52021 and 38% in the rats treated with alprazolam (5 mg/kg). with statistically significant differences between treated and untreated groups. 4. Clearance of p-aminohippuric acid was also improved with BN-52021 or alprazolam treatment. 5. This protective effect of BN-52021 was observed in a more prolonged follow-up (3 days). 6. Glomeruli from rats with acute renal failure. treated or untreated with BN-52021. showed similar amounts of platelet-activating factor. whereas it was undetectable in glomeruli from normal rats. Furthermore. rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure released greater amounts of platelet-activating factor. 7. These results provide evidence of a role for platelet-activating factor in the genesis of this model of experimental acute renal failure.',\n",

Blood cells and vascular endothelial cells are subjected to a wide range of haemodynamically generated shear stress forces. In vitro. membrane stretching or shear stress have been observed to activate ion channels and cell metabolism and to facilitate erythrocyte and platelet aggregation. 2. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of shear stresses in the control of apparent platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in hypertensive patients. 3. Shear conditions and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro were studied after a dynamic perturbation induced by 3 months of double-blind treatment with one of two beta-antagonists. carteolol and atenolol. Brachial artery wall shear rate and stress were estimated by means of a pulsed Doppler velocimeter. and blood viscosity was measured by a co-axial viscometer at a shear rate of 96 s-1. Platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was simultaneously measured by using the Quin-2 fluorescent chelator. The direct effect of atenolol and carteolol on platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro was also measured after addition of the beta-blockers to platelet-rich plasma. 4. Atenolol and carteolol decreased blood pressure similarly but their effects on shear rate (P less than 0.02). shear stress (P less than 0.01) and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.05) differed after 3 months of therapy. In contrast. neither of the drugs significantly altered platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. in vitro per se. 5. In the overall population. strong positive correlations existed not only between changes in platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and those in shear rate (r = 0.81. P less than 0.001) and shear stress (r = 0.83. P less than 0.001). but also between their absolute values. suggesting a possible haemodynamic shear-dependent modulation of transmembrane Ca2+ transport.',\n",

Serum electrolyte concentrations. daily urinary volume. and daily losses of sodium. potassium. and chloride were measured in all patients. Daily fecal weight and daily losses of sodium and potassium were analyzed in patients with ileoanal anastomosis or conventional ileostomy. Serum chloride in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in those with conventional ileostomy or in nonoperated patients. Daily urinary loss of sodium in nonoperated patients was significantly higher than in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (P less than 0.01) or conventional ileostomy (P less than 0.05). Daily urinary loss of chloride in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in nonoperated patients. Daily fecal loss of potassium in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than in those with conventional ileostomy. Daily urinary volume and fecal weight did not differ significantly in patients with ileoanal anastomosis or conventional ileostomy. The present study indicates that changes in water and sodium balance after ileoanal anastomosis are similar to those after conventional ileostomy but chloride balance is more altered after ileoanal anastomosis.',\n",

After withdrawal. colorectal transit time significantly increased from 24.9 +/- 3.6 to 33.3 +/- 4.5 hours mean +/- SE (P less than 0.01). This was the result of an exclusive increase in rectosigmoid transit time from 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.8 +/- 2.1 hours (P less than 0.001). No variations were found in right or left colon transit time.

We attempted to identify the causative agents by an experimental screening method in animals. Guinea pigs were sensitized with an acetone extract of the sweater material. by means of the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Active ingredients were then separated from the extract. by step-by-step patch test screening of chromatographic fractions in the guinea pigs. and finally analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Although there were 2 allergens with important activity (1 in the fraction eluted from the silica gel column with hexane. and 1 in the methanol fraction). the present study is focussed on the fat-soluble allergens in the hexane fraction. GC-MS analysis revealed that 4 kinds of phosgene (chlorophenyl)hydrazones (PCPHs) were present in the hexane fraction.

Innovative advances in both morphologic and functional imaging have led to a dramatic improvement in our ability to diagnose and monitor human cancer. Frequently. anatomic detail can be demonstrated in ways that exceed views at surgery. and functional biochemical imaging is being used to show the metabolic activity and receptor status of normal and pathologic states. In vivo functional and biochemical studies differentiate normal from neoplastic or nonviable tissue. and make it possible to measure progression or regression of the disease. Because physiologic changes often precede morphologic findings in many disease processes. the use of in vivo biochemical probes can demonstrate disease before anatomic abnormalities become evident. Gross changes in anatomy are no longer adequate endpoints for therapy protocols. Today. using physiologic imaging. we can evaluate the response to treatment within hours of administration of therapy. Adjuvant metabolic tumor imaging studies provide complimentary information to morphologic evaluation of human cancers that will ultimately lead to better patient care.',\n",

Mean follow-up was 12 years (range. 0.1 to 17.7 years). The actuarial survival rate at 18 years was 84.2% (70% confidence limits. 79% to 88%) for simple TGA and 93.7% (70% confidence limits. 84% to 97%) for complex TGA. Nine of the 11 deaths were sudden. Two (2.6%) of the 78 late survivors operated on for simple TGA are in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV versus 4 (26.7%) of the 15 survivors with complex TGA; the other patients are doing very well. To better assess long-term results. we report the findings for randomly obtained electrocardiograms.

The findings confirm that the arterial switch repair is the procedure of choice for complex TGA and that there is a major incidence (approximately 10%) of systemic right ventricular dysfunction and rhythm disturbances after the atrial repair. On the other hand. our late survival rate at 18 years of 84% for simple TGA with 97.5% of the patients in functional class I is a result that should be kept in mind. especially in institutions where the arterial switch is a relatively new approach and presumably is a higher risk to cause early death.',\n",

Pneumonia occurred approximately 4 days after the operation. Thirty-six controls were randomly selected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operations in 1988. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a history of chronic obstructive lung disease. duration of more than 2 days of mechanical ventilation after operation but before diagnosis of pneumonia. and receipt of gastric acid inhibitors (antacids or H2-blockers) were independent risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia. Only the last risk factor was amenable to intervention at the time of operation.',\n",

The median survival of the remaining 24 patients after thoracotomy was 18.5 +/- 5.9 months. and the actuarial 5-year survival was 22%. Five patients (5/24. 21%) achieved a clinically complete response with preoperative chemotherapy. but all had recurrence in the lung and underwent resection of pulmonary metastases. Seven patients (7/24. 29%) achieved a partial response and had residual disease resected at thoracotomy. Twelve patients (12/24. 50%) showed either no change or disease progression while receiving chemotherapy and were referred for resection. Postthoracotomy disease-free survival and postthoracotomy overall survival did not differ significantly between the three groups. One patient in the group showing no change or progression of disease while receiving chemotherapy is alive without recurrence 57 months after initial pulmonary metastasectomy. Chemotherapy can be used for the initial treatment of pulmonary metastases from adult soft-tissue sarcomas. However. survival after resection of pulmonary metastases cannot be accurately predicted based on the clinical response to preoperative chemotherapy.',\n",
       " '23, Emergency aortocoronary bypass after failed angioplasty, One thousand two hundred fourteen percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties were performed over a 38-month period. Sixty patients required immediate emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after angioplasty failure; 7 of these had evidence of acute myocardial infarction before angioplasty and were excluded from the study. Of the 53 patients remaining. 27 (51%) had electrocardiographic and enzyme evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. Two patients died (4%). and 10 had postoperative complications (19%). No statistical significance was noted comparing age. sex. incidence of prior myocardial infarction or myocardial dysfunction. time for revascularization. or average number of grafts completed in those with single-vessel (n = 21) versus multiple-vessel (n = 32) coronary artery disease. Postoperatively. those with multiple-vessel disease required intraaortic balloon pump support (p = 0.06) and antiarrhythmic medications more frequently than single-vessel patients (p less than 0.01) and had a higher complication rate (p less than 0.05). Although not reaching statistical significance. the data also suggest a higher death and postoperative myocardial infarction rate in patients with multiple-vessel disease. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty carries a higher morbidity and mortality than elective coronary artery bypass grafting. particularly for patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease.',\n",
       " '4, Esophageal malignancies: is preoperative radiotherapy the way to go, During the period 1969 to 1988. 68 patients with esophageal malignancy were subjected to preoperative radiotherapy consisting of 30 Gy over 3 weeks followed by esophagectomy after a wait of 2 weeks. Sixty-two of 68 patients (91%) were followed up retrospectively (5-year survival rate. 17.2%; 10-year survival rate. 4.8%). Radiosensitivity of the tumor was graded by a radiation effect scoring method devised by us. and this was found to correlate with long-term prognosis (p = 0.05). Radiotherapy \"sterilized\" malignant involvement of adventitia and draining lymph nodes in 8 patients and thereby converted \"palliative\" into potentially \"curative\" resections with a mean survival of 57.2 months in this group of patients. Preoperative radiotherapy was found to increase the survival. decrease the incidence of residual tumor at the resected stump. reduce the incidence of local recurrence. and increase the resectability rate.',\n",
       " '23, Long-term results of Ionescu-Shiley valve in the tricuspid position, A retrospective analysis of the long-term results of using the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial bioprosthesis in the tricuspid position was carried out on 73 patients (8 men. 65 women). Of these procedures. ten were tricuspid valve replacement alone and the remainder were in combination with other valve procedures. The mean follow-up was 9.6 years (range. 4 to 18 years). The mean age of the patients was 53 years (range. 27 to 78 years). Seventy-one of the patients suffered tricuspid valve dysfunction from rheumatic heart disease. There were 13 postoperative deaths (within 30 days). giving a mortality rate of 17.8%. The actuarial survival at 10 years was 71% +/- 4.2%. Of the survivors. 49 (79.6%) were in functional class I or II. Primary tissue valve failure in the tricuspid position occurred in 1 patient 12 years after implantation and required reoperation. In another patient bioprosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis developed. There was no incidence of thromboembolic complications. We conclude that the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial bioprosthesis was a satisfactory prosthesis in the tricuspid position in patients with acquired valvar dysfunction.',\n",
       " '4, Expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor and its receptor in gynecologic malignancies, Recently. hematopoietic growth factors have been implicated in protean nonhematopoietic processes. In the current study. expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and its receptor (the c-fms proto-oncogene) was investigated in 42 samples of gynecologic tissues. There were 15 samples of normal ovarian and uterine tissue or benign conditions of these organs; 11 samples of primary ovarian cancer tissue; seven samples of metastatic ovarian cancer tissue; and nine samples of primary endometrial cancer tissue. Steady state transcript levels were assessed by Northern Blot analysis. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) expression was not observed in any of the specimens of benign abnormalities or of normal organs; c-fms expression was detected in two of 15 (13%) of these specimens. albeit at very low levels. In contrast. 14 (78%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens. and five (55%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed M-CSF. Similarly. 16 (89%) of 18 ovarian tumor specimens and six (67%) of nine endometrial tumor specimens expressed c-fms. Most positive malignant tissues (19 [86%] of 22) showed coexpression of M-CSF and c-fms. Of interest. M-CSF and c-fms mRNA were detected in tumor. but not in adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore. M-CSF and c-fms transcripts were produced by all metastatic tumors. including two cases in which the corresponding primary tumor from the same patient was negative. Because M-CSF mediates its effects by binding to its receptor. the increased levels of both these gene products in gynecologic malignancies suggest that an interaction between M-CSF and c-fms may participate in the development of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas and especially in progression to the metastatic state.',\n",
       " '4, Detection by CT during arterial portography of colorectal cancer metastases to liver, A prospective evaluation of the accuracy of real-time ultrasonography (US). computed tomography (CT). infusion hepatic angiography (IHA). and computed tomography during arterial portography (CT-AP) was performed on 65 resected liver metastases of colorectal cancers. The total detection rate was 58.5 percent for US. 56.3 percent for CT. 55.4 percent for IHA. and 86.2 percent for CT-AP. The sensitivity of 29 lesions with diameters of smaller than 1 cm was 65.5 percent for CT-AP. CT found only two. and both US and IHA localized no more than three. The smallest lesions detectable by CT-AP were as small as 0.4 cm in diameter. CT-AP proved most useful in detecting the liver metastases. and the use of this technique is recommended for preoperative planning of hepatectomy on patients with liver metastases.',\n",
       " '6, Rectopexy is an ineffective treatment for obstructed defecation, The symptoms of obstructed defecation have been attributed to rectal intussusception. and thus rectopexy has been advocated in the surgical management. In this study. patients with obstructed defecation underwent manometry and proctography before and after rectopexy. Seventeen patients (16 females and one male. mean age 51.6 years) were studied. Eleven underwent anterior and posterior fixation of the rectum and six had posterior fixation only. Preoperatively five patients demonstrated rectoanal intussusceptions. Fifteen had significant pelvic descent. No significant change in maximum resting pressure. maximum voluntary contraction. pelvic descent. or anorectal angle was seen postoperatively. In the initial follow-up. many patients had significant amelioration of symptoms. However. on longer follow-up (mean 30.8 months) only two had long-term improvement. The remainder had a poor clinical result in spite of complete resolution of rectal intussusception. Many reported a worsening of symptoms as reflected by an increase in tenesmus and stool frequency. In the two cases with a satisfactory result. both could empty the rectum completely and demonstrated rectoanal intussusception on preoperative evacuation proctography. In those with poor results. four had complete emptying and three had rectoanal intussusception. In conclusion rectopexy is an ineffective treatment for obstructive defecation in most patients.',\n",
       " '23, The role of sphincteroplasty for fecal incontinence reevaluated: a prospective physiologic and functional review, Sixteen female patients (mean age 54.1 years; range 34-74 years) with a 9.8-year (range 1-25 years) history of incontinence to solid stool underwent overlapping sphincteroplasty with internal sphincter imbrication without fecal diversion. All patients were prospectively evaluated with preoperative anorectal manometry. electromyography. and pudendal nerve motor latency assessment. postoperative anorectal manometry. and preoperative and postoperative functional evaluation. Mean and maximal resting pressures increased from 30 mm Hg and 49 mm Hg preoperatively to 40 mm Hg and 57 mm Hg. respectively. postoperatively. Likewise. mean and maximal squeeze pressures increased from 27 mm Hg and 48 mm Hg preoperatively to 39 mm Hg and 73 mm Hg. respectively. postoperatively (P less than 0.01). Furthermore. anal canal high pressure zone length was increased by sphincteroplasty from a mean of 0.9 cm (range 0-3 cm) to a mean of 2.1 cm (range 1-4 cm). These objective physiologic improvements correlated well with subjective functional improvement. Subjectively. functional outcome was rated by patients as excellent in 38 percent. good in 38 percent. fair in 19 percent. and poor in only 5 percent of cases. Overlapping sphincteroplasty with internal sphincter imbrication improves both the anal sphincter physiologic profile and fecal continence.',\n",
       " '4, DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors, The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern. whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value.',\n",
       " '4, Subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer in New Zealand, 1974-1983, The purpose of this study was to examine changes in subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer within different age groups. Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974. The present study was based on 15.395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983. Subsite distribution (right colon. left colon. rectum) for different age groups (25-49. 50-69. 70+ years) was significantly skewed. with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years. This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer. Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite. Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years. This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes. There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years. In contrast. the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals. Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts.',\n",

Results of a prospective randomized trial, To determine whether primary fistulectomy should be performed or not at the time of incision and drainage. a prospective. randomized study in 70 patients with anorectal abscess was conducted. Thirty-six patients underwent incision. drainage and fistulectomy with primary partial internal spincterectomy (group I). whereas in 34 patients anorectal abscess was treated by incision and drainage alone (group II). After a median follow-up of 42.5 months. the combined recurrence or persistence rate was 2.9 percent in group I and 40.6 percent in group II (P less than 0.0003. log-rank test). Recurrent abscesses or persistent fistulas were treated by secondary partial internal sphincterectomy. Comparing anal continence before and 1 year after definite treatment. we found increased anal function disturbances in 39.4 percent of the patients in group I and in 21.4 percent of the patients in group II (P less than 0.106. Fisher-exact test). The combined recurrence or persistence rate of 40.6 percent indicates that more than half of the patients with anorectal abscess will have no further problems after simple incision and drainage. This finding. as well as the increased anal function disturbances after partial internal sphincterectomy (either primary or secondary) are the main reasons to reserve fistulectomy as a second stage procedure if necessary.',\n",
       " '4, Intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas: Leuchtenberger bodies revisited, The presence of intraepithelial inclusion bodies (Leuchtenberger bodies) was recorded in rectal or colonic specimens from 130 patients. Large to moderate number of intraepithelial bodies were recorded in 81.8 percent of 55 colorectal adenomas from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Conversely. none of the 55 non-FAP adenomas or of the 20 specimens with ulcerative colitis (10 with dysplasia) had similar amounts of intraepithelial granules. Feulgen studies demonstrated that the granules contain DNA and are probably nuclear fragments of destroyed lymphocytes. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon remains obscure. it appears that the presence of large to moderate number of intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas should strongly raise the suspicion of FAP.',\n",
       " '4, Colorectal cancer: differences between community and geographically distant patients seen at an urban medical center, Many studies in clinical oncology rely on hospital-derived patients. Hospitals vary in the proportions of patients from the local catchment area vs. those from more distant places. of whom a larger proportion are presumably referrals. To study the differences between these two types of patients. we analyzed 1.245 colorectal cancer patients seen at a large urban medical center over a seven-year period. Three hundred ninety-eight patients were from the local community (32 percent). 489 were from the extended community (39.3 percent). and 358 from more distant communities (28.8 percent). The patients from the local community tended to be older and from minority ethnic groups. In addition. the local community patients were more likely to have advanced disease at the time of presentation. The grade of the tumor and its site distribution within the large bowel were similar for the three groups. After adjusting for age. sex. race. and stage of disease. the survival was somewhat better for the distant community patients as compared with the local and extended communities (P less than 0.02). Overall. in our patient population. the distant patients tended to have more favorable socioeconomic factors and less advanced disease. and these differences may account. in large part. for a better prognosis for these patients. Particularly in large cooperative trials. studies may need to take into account the respective proportions of local community and geographically distant patients in analyzing and generalizing treatment outcomes.',\n",
       " '14, Congestive heart failure, coronary events and atherothrombotic brain infarction in elderly blacks and whites with systemic hypertension and with and without echocardiographic and electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, Hypertension was present in 50% of 196 blacks and in 36% of 382 whites (p less than 0.001). A prospective study of 84 elderly blacks (70% women) and 326 elderly whites (73% women) with hypertension correlated echocardiographic and electrocardiographic left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with incidences of congestive heart failure (CHF). coronary events and atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI). Echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p less than 0.02) and concentric LV hypertrophy (p less than 0.001) were more prevalent in hypertensive blacks than in hypertensive whites. Hypertensive blacks were younger (78 +/- 9 years) than hypertensive whites (82 +/- 7 years) (p less than 0.001). Other coronary risk factors were similar. except for higher serum triglycerides in whites than in blacks (p less than 0.02). Follow-up was 37 +/- 18 months in blacks and 43 +/- 18 months in whites (p less than 0.01). Incidences of CHF and coronary events were not significantly different in blacks and whites. ABI incidence was 38% in blacks and 21% in whites (p less than 0.005). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that prior CHF (p = 0.000). concentric LV hypertrophy (p = 0.018) and echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.022) were independent risk factors for CHF. Echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.001). serum total cholesterol (p = 0.002). concentric LV hypertrophy (p = 0.005) and prior coronary artery disease (p = 0.042) were independent risk factors for coronary events. Prior ABI (p = 0.001). echocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.001) and electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy (p = 0.034) were independent risk factors for ABI.',\n",
       " '23, Quality of life in elderly, chronically ill outpatients, Quality of life (QL) in elderly outpatients is poorly characterized. We interviewed 258 elderly outpatients from three health care settings to identify the attributes and events that affect self-assessment of QL. These outpatients rated their QL as acceptable. citing medical care. health. interpersonal relationships. financial status. and functional status as affecting their QL. Overall QL ratings were not strongly associated with objective indicators such as demographic characteristics and use of health care services. Subjective indicators. including patient perceptions of health. memory. and financial concerns. were correlated independently with global QL (sigma R2 = .35). We conclude that older. chronically ill patients generally consider their QL to be acceptable and affected by a variety of factors. including their perceptions of their emotional. socioeconomic. intellectual. and physical functioning. Furthermore. QL is poorly associated with objective indicators. Thus. in assessing the QL of elderly. chronically ill outpatients. physicians should elicit information regarding these perceptions.',\n",
       " '15, Preferential expression of human Fc gamma RIIIPMN (CD16) in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Discordant expression of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, The isoform of Fc gamma RIII (CD16) expressed on PMN has a GPI membrane anchor. and in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) there is a deficiency in Fc gamma RIII expression on PMN. Contrary to expectation. however. CD16 expression is preserved (albeit at reduced levels) in all affected PNH PMN that completely lack the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (CD55) and CD59. Fc gamma RIII negative PMN are not observed in any of the six PNH patients examined in this study. Analysis of the molecular weight of both glycosylated and deglycosylated Fc gamma RIII from PMN with reduced Fc gamma RIII expression indicates no variations in size relative to normal donor Fc gamma RIIIPMN. Indeed. the Fc gamma RIII expressed at intermediate levels is phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)-sensitive. Thus. there is no evidence suggestive of expression of a transmembrane isoform and all data indicate that Fc gamma RIIIPMN on affected cells in PNH is a GPI-linked isoform. With Fc gamma RIIIPMN expression preserved at reduced levels on affected cells in PNH. PMN from PNH patients retain the capacity to internalize the Fc gamma RIIIPMN-specific probe E-ConA (at reduced levels) as well as IgG-opsonized erythrocytes. Reduced expression of GPI-anchored molecules on PNH PMN is not restricted to Fc gamma RIIIPMN since intermediate levels of CD59 were observed in the PNH PMN that were decay-accelerating factor (DAF)-negative and Fc gamma RIIIPMN intermediate. In addition. discordant expression of GPI-linked molecules in individual cells is not restricted to PMN since DAF+/CD14- monocytes were observed in one PNH patient. These data suggest that. when analyzed on an individual cell level. the GPI anchor defect in PNH is not absolute and must involve either a hierarchy of access of different protein molecules to available GPI anchors. distinct anchor biochemistries for the different proteins. or differential regulation of protein-anchor assembly.',\n",
       " '4, Coexpression of two fibronectin receptors, VLA-4 and VLA-5, by immature human erythroblastic precursor cells, Human erythroblastic precursor cells adhere to fibronectin (Fn) but the exact nature of the receptors mediating this interaction has not been characterized. In this study. we report data showing that immature human erythroblasts express the integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 and that both these molecules act as fibronectin receptors on these cells. We have recently demonstrated that adhesion to Fn of purified human CFU-E and their immediate progeny preproerythroblasts was inhibited by antibodies directed against the human fibronectin receptor (VLA-5). Here we have extended those results and characterized by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies the integrins expressed on surface-labeled normal human immature erythroblasts. A polyclonal antibody recognizing the common VLA beta 1 subunit yielded two polypeptides of 120 and 160 kD. Our data further demonstrate that the polypeptide of 160 kD contains alpha subunits corresponding to both alpha 4 and alpha 5. Thus. erythroblast lysates prepared in 0.3% CHAPS and immunoprecipitated with antibodies which specifically recognize the alpha 4 subunit showed a heterodimer with peptides of 120 (beta 1) and 160 kD (alpha 4) and the additional peptides of 70 and 80 kD which usually coprecipitate with the alpha 4 chain. On the other hand. specific anti-alpha 5 antibodies immunoprecipitated an alpha 5/beta 1 complex with peptides of 120 and 160 kD which under reducing conditions migrated as a single band of 130 kD. Similar experiments performed with an erythroleukemic cell line (KU 812) showed that these cells also coexpress both the VLA-4 and VLA-5 members of the integrin family. Furthermore. monoclonal antibodies recognizing the VLA alpha 4 chain blocked the adhesion of immature erythroblasts to Fn-coated surfaces. thus demonstrating that. as VLA-5. VLA-4 is also a functional Fn receptor on these cells.',\n",

       " \"14, Effect of age on coronary circulation after imposition of pressure-overload in rats, We examined the effects of pressure overload on coronary circulation in young adult (7 months old) and old rats (18 months old). Four weeks after the ascending aorta was banded. in vivo left ventricular pressure was measured to estimate the degree of pressure load. In the two age groups. similar increases in peak left ventricular pressure were observed (113 +/- 7 mm Hg in sham-operated rats versus 160 +/- 11 mm Hg in banded rats of the young adult group; 103 +/- 7 mm Hg in sham-operated rats versus 156 +/- 11 mm Hg in banded rats of the old group). After isolating the hearts. they were perfused with Tyrode's solution containing bovine red blood cells and albumin. Resting coronary perfusion pressure-flow relations and reactive hyperemic response after a 40-second ischemia were obtained under beating but nonworking conditions. In young adult banded rats. significant myocardial hypertrophy was observed at the organ level (124% of controls in left ventricular dry weight/body weight ratio; 119% in left ventricular dry weight/tibial length ratio) and at the cell level. Minimal coronary vascular resistance obtained by the perfusion pressure-peak flow relation during reactive hyperemia increased to 150% of controls. and coronary flow reserve decreased significantly. In contrast. myocardial hypertrophy was not observed at the organ or cell level in old banded rats. However. minimal coronary vascular resistance increased. and flow reserve decreased significantly. Thus. pressure overload with coronary arterial hypertension caused abnormalities of the coronary circulation in old subjects even in the absence of myocardial hypertrophy.\",\n",
       " '14, Specific supersensitivity of the mesenteric vascular bed of Dahl salt-sensitive rats, Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were maintained on a diet containing normal (0.45%) or high (7%) salt for 5 days. The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats. although a high salt diet failed to significantly elevate pressure in either group when compared with their appropriate (low salt diet) controls. The sensitivity of the isolated. perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM). A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine. The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response. No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl. angiotensin II. 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine. These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term. high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure. Differences in the effectiveness of cocaine among the groups suggest that differences may exist in neuronal uptake (uptake 1).',\n",

In the current study. the effect of dietary NaCl supplementation on arterial baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate was assessed in SHR-S and control SHR-R and WKY rats. Male SHR-S. SHR-R. and WKY rats were fed diets containing either 1% or 8% NaCl beginning at 7 weeks of age and were studied at age 9-10 weeks. Arterial baroreceptor reflex-mediated changes in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate were recorded in conscious. unrestrained rats during phenylephrine-induced (15-40 micrograms/kg/min) and nitroprusside-induced (15-300 micrograms/kg/min) changes in mean arterial pressure. SHR-S maintained on a 1% NaCl diet had blunted baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity during acute increases in MAP compared with SHR-R and WKY rats (p less than 0.05). After ingestion of the 8% NaCl diet. this blunting was absent. indicating enhancement of baroreceptor reflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity. SHR-S maintained on a 1% NaCl diet also had blunted arterial baroreceptor control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity during nitroprusside-induced decreases in mean arterial pressure compared with WKY rats. but this was not significantly altered during ingestion of the 8% NaCl diet.',\n",

The Na(+)-H+ antiporter activation kinetics were studied by varying cell pH and measuring net Na+ influx (mmol/l cell x hr = units) driven by an outward H+ gradient. The Na(+)-Li+ exchange was determined at pH 7.4 as sodium-stimulated Li+ efflux. Untreated hypertensive patients (n = 30) had a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-Li+ exchange (0.43 +/- 0.05 versus 0.26 +/- 0.02 units. p less than 0.0003). a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-H+ exchange (62.3 +/- 6.2 versus 47 +/- 4 units; p less than 0.02). but a similar affinity for cell pH compared with normotensive subjects (n = 46). The cell pH activation of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter exhibited a lower Hill coefficient than that of normotensive subjects (1.61 +/- 0.12 versus 2.56 +/- 0.14; p less than 0.0001). This index of occupancy of internal H+ regulatory sites was found reduced in most of the hypertensive patients (73%) whether their hypertension was untreated or treated. Hypertensive patients with Na(+)-Li+ exchange above 0.35 units (0.68 +/- 0.057 units. n = 16) did not exhibit elevated maximal rates of Na(+)-H+ exchange (57.3 +/- 10 units. NS) in comparison with those with Na(+)-Li+ exchange below 0.35 units (66.4 +/- 7.6 units. n = 26). but both groups exhibited reduced Hill coefficients. Hypertensive patients with enhanced Na(+)-H+ exchange activity (more than 90 units) had normal maximal rates of Na(+)-Li+ exchange.',\n",
       " '12, Small artery resistance increases during the development of renal hypertension, Vascular pressures were measured in the principal (A1) arteriole and in upstream small arteries of the rat cremaster muscle to investigate vascular resistance changes associated with one-kidney. one clip Goldblatt hypertension. Pressure measurements were made at a proximal and distal site of each vessel using a servonull micropipette system. Vessel diameters were measured using video microscopy. A1 arteriole and external spermatic artery diameters were both decreased after 2 and 4 weeks of hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was elevated after 2 weeks of hypertension (106 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 140 +/- 5 mm Hg). Likewise. vascular pressures were elevated at every site: pudicepigastric artery (36%). external spermatic artery (47%). and A1 arteriole (38%). The pressure drop along the external spermatic artery was increased (87%) after 2 weeks of hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was further elevated from 2-4 weeks of hypertension (105 +/- 4 mm Hg versus 162 +/- 7 mm Hg) but only the proximal pudic-epigastric artery pressure was further elevated during this time from 2 to 4 weeks (131 +/- 5 mm Hg versus 147 +/- 7 mm Hg) of hypertension development. This was associated with an increased pressure drop (87%) along the artery compared with the situation at 2 weeks. These data indicate that small arteries upstream from the microcirculation contribute significantly to the increase in vascular resistance during hypertension. In addition. these data indicate that the increases in small artery resistance do not develop uniformly throughout all vessel branches.',\n",

Recent studies have shown that leukocytes play a key role in several cardiovascular diseases. As an initial step toward investigating the role of leukocytes in hypertension. we measured leukocyte counts and spontaneous activation of granulocytes of freshly drawn unseparated blood samples in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in their normotensive counterpart. Wistar-Kyoto rats. The animals were derived from one breeder in the United States and from two breeders in Europe. Total leukocyte counts in young. mature. and old hypertensive rats were 50-100% above the controls. The number of granulocytes in mature and old spontaneously hypertensive rats in more than 100% elevated compared with control rats. In young hypertensive rats the mean granulocyte count was only slightly elevated. The number of spontaneously activated granulocytes. as detected by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. increases with age in both species; in mature spontaneously hypertensive rats. it is more than 300% above the values in the controls. Furthermore. in mature hypertensive rats the number of monocytes. activated monocytes. and the lymphocyte count are also significantly elevated over the values in the normotensive controls. It is proposed that these elevated leukocyte counts may constitute an enhanced risk for organ injury in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.',\n",
       " '10, Effects of antihypertensive therapy on mechanics of cerebral arterioles in rats, The purpose of this study was to examine effects of antihypertensive treatment on structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles and the incidence of stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Treatment of hypertension was begun at 3 months of age with cilazapril (45 mg/kg/day). an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. or with hydralazine (18 mg/kg/day). Cilazapril and hydralazine reduced systolic arterial pressure (from 195 +/- 8 to 125 +/- 5 and 148 +/- 3 mm Hg. respectively [mean +/- SEM]; p less than 0.05). To examine structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles. we measured pressure (servonull). external diameter. and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (histologically) in pial arterioles of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHRSP that were untreated or that were treated for 3 months with cilazapril or with hydralazine. Arterioles were maximally dilated with EDTA. In WKY rats. cilazapril and hydralazine did not alter pial arteriolar pressure. external diameter. or cross-sectional area of the vessel wall. In SHRSP. both cilazapril and hydralazine reduced cross-sectional area of the vessel wall to levels not significantly different from WKY rats (from 1.911 +/- 155 to 1.244 +/- 101 and 1.388 +/- 59 microns 2. respectively. compared with 1.405 +/- 95 microns 2 for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril was more effective than hydralazine in reducing pial arteriolar pressure (from 110 +/- 6 to 62 +/- 2 mm Hg with cilazapril versus 79 +/- 5 mm Hg for hydralazine compared with 60 +/- 4 mm Hg for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril. but not hydralazine. attenuated reductions in external diameter of pial arterioles (from 91 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 4 microns for cilazapril versus 91 +/- 3 microns for hydralazine compared with 107 +/- 3 microns for untreated WKY rats).',\n",
       " '21, Increased intraocular pressure in severely burned patients, Six eyes of three patients with severe body burns had intraocular pressure ranging from 37.2 to 81.7 mm Hg. Because of extreme orbital congestion. lateral canthotomies were performed. which caused abrupt decrease in intraocular pressure (range. 17.6 to 49.0 mm Hg). None of the patients had a history of glaucoma. narrow angles. or any precondition for a pupillary block mechanism. Two patients survived and neither had optic nerve damage or increased intraocular pressure after hospital discharge. Tonometry should be performed in patients with severe burns and orbital congestion. especially in those patients receiving large amounts of intravenous fluids. Lateral canthotomies may be of benefit to relieve potentially damaging high intraocular pressure.',\n",
       " '15, Abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis in the Belgrade laboratory rat, The Belgrade laboratory (b/b) rat has a hereditary hypochromic microcytic anemia because of defective transmembrane iron transport into erythroblasts. The present study was prompted by our previous work in which we showed that the b/b rat has hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia associated with increased megakaryocyte size. To define the basic mechanism underlying this abnormality in the b/b rat we have studied both megakaryocytopoiesis and granulopoiesis in anemic b/b rats. chronically transfused b/b rats. iron-treated b/b rats. and controls. We have found decreased concentrations of megakaryocyte and granulocyte progenitors in the marrow of b/b rats. Full correction of the severe anemia by chronic transfusion resulted in normalization of megakaryocyte progenitors. small acetylcholinesterase positive cells. megakaryocyte size. and platelet counts. along with granulocyte progenitors. In contrast. the partial correction of anemia obtained by iron treatment resulted in improvement. but not normalization. of these parameters. These findings indicate that abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis in the b/b rat can be best interpreted as a consequence of hypoxia because of the severe anemia. Because we have recently shown that the number of erythroid progenitors in b/b rats is also low. we propose that abnormal megakaryocytopoiesis in this animal is a reflection of an acquired stem cell disorder induced by the prolonged hypoxia resulting from the severe anemia.',\n",
       " '23, Interleukin-6 and its receptor are expressed by human megakaryocytes: in vitro effects on proliferation and endoreplication, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in the megakaryocytic differentiation. Recently. we have observed that IL-6 is synthesized by several human cell lines with megakaryocytic features. In this study. we have investigated whether a similar phenomenon occurs during normal megakaryocytic differentiation. Human megakaryocytes (MK) were obtained by culturing normal marrow in liquid culture with aplastic plasma (AP). First. an IL-6 secretion in bone marrow culture enriched in MK as well as in purified MK populations was demonstrated by a biologic assay. Second. IL-6 mRNA was detected in a purified population of MK by the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot analysis. IL-6 mRNA and protein were undetectable in platelets. Third. in situ hybridization procedure demonstrated the presence of IL-6 mRNA in individual immature MK. Fourth. IL-6 protein was detected in MK at the unicellular level by an immunoalkaline phosphatase technique using a monoclonal antibody against IL-6. Furthermore. the presence of IL-6 receptor (IL-6-R) on MK was demonstrated by in situ hybridization using an IL-6-R probe and in situ autoradiography after binding with [125I]-labeled recombinant IL-6. The IL-6 endogenously produced in liquid cultures containing normal human plasma or AP was subsequently neutralized. This resulted in a 50% decrease of the MK growth with a minor shift in the ploidy distribution toward lower values. In semisolid cultures the addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies led to a 42% decrease in colony number in cultures stimulated by IL-3 but not in other conditions of culture. These results suggest that normal human megakaryocytopoiesis might be regulated in part by an IL-6 autocrine loop.',\n",

The performance of the procedure from an external approach minimizes the possibility of oral contamination and. therefore. infection. The procedure has been performed on 10 patients. with a longest follow-up of 3 years. A 93% success rate has been achieved. and bone resorption at the implant sites has thus far been negligible. Prosthetic rehabilitation has been done in 9 of the 10 cases; 3 have been tissue-supported prostheses. and 6 have been completely implant-supported prostheses.',\n",

Vitreoretinal surgical techniques were used to remove the subfoveal membranes. Visual acuity returned to 20/20 with seven months of follow-up in one patient (Case 1) and to 20/40 with three months of follow-up in the other patient (Case 2). No evidence of persistent or current subretinal neovascular membranes in either patient have been noted. These preliminary results suggest that vitreoretinal surgical techniques may be successful in mechanically removing subfoveal neovascular membranes with preservation of overlying neurosensory retina and thus preservation of central visual acuity.',\n",

Four-year event-free and overall survivals were 81% and 88%. respectively. in 419 children lacking t(9;22). but were 0% and 20%. respectively. in 15 children with t(9;22) (P less than .001). Poor outcome for children with t(9;22)-positive ALL was particularly notable because we have reported improved survival in other historically poor prognosis ALL cytogenetic categories when treated with similarly intensive therapy. We recommend that very intensive treatment approaches. including bone marrow transplantation in first remission. be considered for all children with t(9;22)-positive ALL.',\n",
       " \"21, Post-traumatic hyperlipofuscinosis in the human retinal pigment epithelium, Light microscopy (including fluorescence microscopy) and electron microscopy were applied to a study of the photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) complex in a human eye which had been severely traumatised nine months prior to enucleation. The main feature of interest was a massive accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium at the posterior pole. and quantitative fluorescence microscopy provided values three times those obtained in appropriate control tissue. The photoreceptor layer was normal at the posterior pole but became progressively atrophic towards the periphery. The concentration of lipopofuscin was proportional to the degree of preservation of the retinal photoreceptors. By electron microscopy the cells in the RPE were seen to be packed with a mixture of lipofuscin granules and melanolysosomal complexes. but occasional photoreceptor phagosomes were found. Bruch's membrane and the choriocapillaris were normal. We attribute this hitherto unreported abnormality of the RPE after trauma to a dysfunction consequent on an overload of the monolayer by photoreceptor debris at the time of trauma.\",\n",

A choroidal osteoma was suspected. and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour. which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented. thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared. leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography.',\n",
       " '11, Pupil cycle time and early autonomic involvement in ocular leprosy, Ocular complications of leprosy patients often develop insidiously and with few if any symptoms. This study involves measurement of the pupil cycle time (PCT) to evaluate the autonomic nerve system of the iris to determine the presence of subclinical intraocular involvement. The study included 19 lepromatous (LL). 19 borderline lepromatous (BL). and five borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy patients and involved 25 healthy volunteers. 10 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and eight with Duhring disease. The PCT was measured in these groups. In all leprosy groups included in the study the PCT was higher than in the control groups. Moreover. the PCT of the leprosy patients without any intraocular involvement was higher than in the controls. These results show that in the ophthalmic examination of leprosy patients without any symptoms the fact that autonomic nerve system of the eye is affected by the leprosy can often be determined by measuring the PCT.',\n",
       " '11, Electrophysiology and colour perimetry in dominant infantile optic atrophy, A typical finding in dominant infantile optic atrophy (DIOA) is the variation of the phenotypic expression of the DIOA gene even within one family. It is of special interest for genetic consultation to evaluate an examination method for detecting subclinically involved patients. Seven patients of two families were examined. Three of them had the typical symptoms of DIOA: reduced visual acuity. tritan defect. temporal pallor of both optic discs. and a relative central scotoma for white test spots. In visual evoked cortical potentials (VECP) the amplitudes were reduced. and in one patient the latencies were slightly delayed and two patients considerably so. The amplitude of the negative component of the PERG was markedly reduced. while the positive component was normal. In the remaining four family members normal retinal and cortical responses were recorded under standard conditions and visual fields and colour vision (FM 100 hue) were also normal. However. static perimetry with blue test spots showed in two family members enlarged central scotomas. thus proving that they had subclinical DIOA.',\n",
       " '18, The hypothalamic-pituitary axis of streptozotocin-induced diabetic female rats is not normalized by estradiol replacement, Studies in diabetic rats have found abnormalities at the hypothalamic. pituitary. and/or ovarian level but have not controlled for changes in estrogen levels induced by diabetes. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of diabetes on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol (E2). Ovariectomized 60 day old female rats were assigned to control (C. n = 42). diabetic (D. n = 47) or insulin-treated diabetic (DI. n = 16) groups. Diabetes was induced with an injection of streptozotocin in the D and DI groups. In the C. D. and DI groups. estrogen was replaced by implanting blank. 5 micrograms or 20 micrograms E2 pellets sc. Pituitary LH responsiveness to GnRH was assessed in C and D animals. Anterior hypothalamic and midhypothalamic concentrations of proGnRH and GnRH. pituitary LH and FSH and serum levels of LH. and E2 were measured by RIA. Anterior hypothalamic proGnRH concentrations were decreased in diabetic rats treated with 5 micrograms E2 compared to 5 micrograms E2 control animals (P less than 0.05). Midhypothalamic GnRH concentrations were also reduced in D vs. C animals despite comparable estrogen therapy (P less than 0.004). GnRH-stimulated LH levels were greater in E2-treated diabetic females than in similarly treated control rats (P less than 0.001). D and DI animals were more sensitive than controls to the inhibitory effect of estrogen on basal LH levels. Pituitary LH and FSH content was lower in 20 micrograms E2-replaced animals but was not influenced by the diabetic state. These data demonstrate a diabetes-induced decrease in hypothalamic proGnRH and GnRH concentration which is not corrected with E2 replacement. The hyper-responsiveness of the diabetic rat pituitary to GnRH also suggests a chronic lack of GnRH stimulation from the hypothalamus but a continued ability of the pituitary to respond to GnRH.',\n",
       " \"19, Thyroid hormones and 5'-deiodinase in the rat fetus late in gestation: effects of maternal hypothyroidism, Having previously observed that T4 and T3 levels in fetal rat brain and brown adipose tissue are clearly higher than expected from their low circulating levels. we have now studied thyroid hormone concentrations and 5'-deiodinase activities (5'D) in several other rat fetal tissues during the last 6 days of gestation (dg). namely 17-22 dg. This period comprises the onset of fetal thyroid activity. Total thyroidal T4 and T3 contents increased 100- and 400-fold. respectively; T4 concentrations increased 8- to 10-fold in plasma. carcass. lung. and liver. and T3 increased 4.5- to 9-fold. except in plasma and liver. where T3 levels increased less than 2-fold in plasma and 3-fold in liver. During this developmental period 5'D activity increased 5- and 10-fold in fetal liver and lung. respectively. In fetuses from hypothyroid [thyroidectomized (T)] dams. body weight was lower than in fetuses from normal dams. Total thyroidal T4 and T3 contents were initially the same. but decreased markedly in fetuses from T dams by the end of gestation. At the earliest fetal ages studied (17-18 dg) T4 and T3 concentrations were lower in carcass. liver. lung. and brain. although near term there were no consistent differences between the fetal tissues from T and control dams. probably because of compensatory stimulation of thyroidal secretion. Liver 5'D was decreased by 50% throughout gestation. and lung 5'D activities were lower by the end of gestation. Thyroid hormones in placentas from T dams were very low. but increased by the end of gestation because of the contribution by the fetal thyroid. Present results describe the ontogenic profiles for thyroid hormone concentrations and 5'D activities during late fetal development; active regulatory mechanisms are already present at this age. It has been frequently stated that rat fetuses near term are deficient in thyroid hormones. and that their thyroid hormone economy is independent of maternal thyroid status. but present results show that near term. T4 and T3 concentrations in several tissues reach levels that are 50% or more of those described for adult animals. and that fetal thyroid function is influenced by maternal hypothyroidism.\",\n",
       " '13, Evidence that human chorionic gonadotropin/luteinizing hormone receptor down-regulation involves decreased levels of receptor messenger ribonucleic acid, Injection of pseudopregnant rats with pharmacological doses of hCG leads to a characteristic decrease in LH/hCG binding by the isolated luteal cells. The steady state levels of LH/hCG receptor mRNA were determined in rat ovaries during hCG-induced down-regulation of the receptor. Northern blots were performed using a 20-mer probe corresponding to a guanine cytosine-rich carboxyl-terminal untranslated region of the LH/hCG receptor cDNA. The hybridization of the probe to LH/hCG receptor mRNA was highly specific. since the probe hybridized only to rat luteal cell RNA fraction. with no signal detected in nontarget tissues. The LH/hCG receptor level was quantitated by [125I]hCG binding to the isolated membrane fractions from the corresponding treatment and control groups. Examination of mRNA levels of the receptor during hCG-induced down-regulation showed a steady decrease from 0-24 h. followed by a gradual increase to control levels from 24-72 h corresponding to days 8-9 of pseudopregnancy. The [125I]hCG-binding activity during down-regulation paralleled the mRNA profile in both the experimental and control groups. Examination of the levels of mRNA for alpha-actin showed no change during this period. suggesting that the loss of LH/hCG receptor mRNA at 24 h was not due to a general loss of mRNA in luteal cells. These results suggest that hCG-induced down-regulation of the LH/hCG receptor in luteal cells involves regulation of the receptors at the message level.',\n",
       " '13, Retinoic acid stimulates placental hormone secretion by choriocarcinoma cell lines in vitro, Retinoic acid (RA). an active metabolite of vitamin A. is an important mediator of cellular differentiation and has been shown to stimulate human CG (hCG) secretion by JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells in vitro. In order to determine whether RA stimulates the hCG secretion by other trophoblastic cell lines. we evaluated the effect of RA on hCG. hCG-alpha subunit (hCG-alpha). and progesterone secretion in three choriocarcinoma cell lines: JEG-3. JAR. and BeWo. RA stimulated hCG and hCG-alpha secretion in a dose-dependent fashion by each of the three cell lines. The time required to give a statistically significant increment of hCG and hCG-alpha over control cells was 48 h. The addition RA to cholera toxin (10 micrograms/ml) resulted in an additive or synergistic stimulation of hCG and hCG-alpha secretion by the three cell lines. Cycloheximide (1 microM) abolished the effect of RA on hCG and hCG-alpha secretion in the BeWo cell line. Progesterone secretion in response to RA was inconsistent. Progesterone secretion by both JEG-3 and BeWo cell lines were stimulated at high concentrations of RA (1 x 10(-6]. whereas progesterone secretion by JAR cells was not stimulated. Intracellular levels of cAMP were not affected by RA treatment in the JEG and JAR cells. In the dosages used. RA did not significantly alter cell number in any of the cell lines. RA in physiologic concentrations stimulates hCG and hCG-alpha secretion by three choriocarcinoma cell lines in vitro. Whether RA is a physiologic mediator of placental hormone production is unknown.',\n",
       " \"23, The rat glucagon gene is regulated by a protein kinase A-dependent pathway in pancreatic islet cells, A cAMP response element (CRE) has been identified in the proximal 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene. and activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway in fetal rat intestinal cells leads to an increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts. In contrast. the human glucagon gene does not contain a similar CRE. and the results of studies using immortalized rat and hamster islet cell lines have suggested that glucagon gene expression may not be regulated by cAMP. To reconcile these observations. we have studied the control of glucagon gene expression. Incubation of primary rat islet cell cultures with forskolin in the presence of low (0.5 g/liter) or high (2.0 g/L) glucose resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts. Forskolin also stimulated the secretion and synthesis of immunoreactive glucagon. The importance of the protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the regulation of glucagon gene expression was also examined in hamster islet InR1-G9 cells. Cotransfection of a glucagon-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene containing the glucagon CRE and a cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase-A resulted in stimulation of glucagon-CAT activity in hamster islet cells. Catalytic subunit cotransfection also activated somatostatin-CAT. but no activation of RSVCAT was detected. The results of these experiments suggest that the rat glucagon gene is regulated by a protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the endocrine pancreas.\",\n",
       " '5, High concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol stimulate trabecular bone formation in adult female rats, Although the effects of low concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on bone formation and resorption are well described. little is known of the effects of E2 on bone at concentrations that circulate during pregnancy. We. therefore. investigated the effects of administration of high dose E2 to 3-month-old female Wistar rats on biochemical and histomorphometric indices of bone formation and resorption. Animals receiving exogenous E2 (4 mg/kg.day for 17 days; n = 9) showed a mean serum E2 concentration of 17.5 +/- 2.9 nM. compared with 0.6 +/- 0.2 nM in those receiving vehicle alone (n = 10). The bone formation rate. measured at the proximal tibial metaphysis after the administration of double fluorochrome labels. was greatly increased in the E2 group (13.6 +/- 2.0 x 10(-2) microns3/microns2.day) compared to controls (3.9 +/- 0.9). as was serum alkaline phosphatase (E2. 133.6 +/- 10.1 IU; controls. 87.5 +/- 5.5). This increase in the rate of bone formation was associated with a significant increase in trabecular bone volume. E2 treatment did not affect urinary hydroxyproline excretion or histomorphometric indices of bone resorption. These findings suggest that high concentrations of E2 strongly stimulate the formation of trabecular bone. This may represent an important mechanism by which calcium stores are accumulated during pregnancy in rats. in anticipation of the mineral requirements of lactation.',\n",
       " '20, Very long charge runs in systemic lupus erythematosus-associated autoantigens, Systemic lupus erythematosus and other chronic systemic autoimmune diseases are associated with circulating autoantibodies reactive with a limited set of mostly nuclear proteins. Using rigorous statistical methods we have identified segments of highly significant charge concentration in the majority of the characteristic nuclear and cytoplasmic autoantigens. Extremely long runs of charged residues. including some sequences of greater than 20 consecutive charged residues (purely acidic or mixed basic and acidic). occur in about a third of these proteins. whereas equivalent runs are found in less than 3% of other mammalian proteins. The other sequences have less extreme charge clusters. the type and location of which are often conserved between several otherwise nonsimilar antigens. We propose that supercharged surfaces render the targeted host proteins strongly immunogenic and that antinuclear antibody profiles might result from chronic exposure to intracellular contents. possibly in conjunction with crossreactive viral products. The limited number of potential systemic autoantigens may partly be due to the rarity of requisite charge properties.',\n",

Urinary sodium concentration and renal epithelial exchange between sodium and potassium were normal. This was felt to be due to an autosomal recessive disorder. Both siblings were later diagnosed as having a bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss with intermittent conductive overlay due to middle ear fluid.

We therefore repeated the study in 51 otherwise healthy children (100 ears) attending kindergarten. Tympanometry was performed daily for one month using both the conventional impedance apparatus AZ7 and the automatic impedance tympanoscope ZS 331. The impedance apparatus did not indicate any one-day type B tympanograms and only a few short-lasting episodes occurring either in the beginning or end of the study period. Several ears had type B tympanograms on all days examined. The point prevalence was 15 per cent and the period prevalence 17 per cent. which accord well with findings of previous epidemiological studies of secretory otitis. The impedance tympanoscope indicated 16 cases of B-curves lasting only one day and considerably higher point and period prevalences. which make the impedance tympanoscope unsuited for both scientific and clinical purposes.\",\n",

Hearing loss is a common sequela of head trauma. The results of pure tone and auditory brain-stem response (ABR) assessment of minor head injury revealed that 20 per cent of these cases showed impairment of hearing including both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss mostly in the high frequencies loss. ABR findings showed a significant difference of absolute wave V latency and interwave (III-V) latencies at repetition rate 11.1 click/sec.. and a highly significant difference at a repetition rate of 51.1 click/sec.. compared with the control group. In severe head injury. conductive hearing loss was found in only one case. in which a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone was identified radiologically. No ABR could be recorded at a repetition rate of 11.1 click/sec. in either ear of this case; this patient died a few days later. Three cases were found with a mixed sensorineural hearing loss; one of them showed a longitudinal fracture radiologically. ABR findings in two cases showed prolongation of wave V and I-V interwave latencies. and the third case showed absence of ABR recording. In comatose patients. an ABR grading system is a more sensitive index of brainstem dysfunction than the simple division of normal versus abnormal ABR waves and interwave latencies. Presence or prolongation of wave V and interwave latency I-V even in one ear is of good prognostic value in the comatosed patient.',\n",

Overview of study design, Although much is known about the virus believed by most experts to be the cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and about its pathogenic actions. major areas of ignorance remain. Among these are the reasons for the varying time between infection with human immunodeficiency virus and development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. the relationship between neurologic and medical aspects of the disease. the time course of neuropsychological findings. and the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. We assessed 124 homosexual men who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus and 84 who were negative for the virus. In this article we describe the study design. method of recruitment. and medical and demographic characteristics of the cohort. which will be followed up for 5 years.',\n",
       " '2, Depression, distress, lymphocyte subsets, and human immunodeficiency virus symptoms on two occasions in HIV-positive homosexual men, We evaluated the extent to which depressive disorders. psychiatric distress. and psychosocial stressors are related to three measures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) illness. both cross-sectionally and during a 6-month period. in a community sample of 124 HIV-positive homosexual men. The dependent variables are immune status measured by CD4 and CD8 cell subsets. number of signs and symptoms commonly associated with HIV infection. and a cumulative index of HIV illness stage. We chose to focus on CD4 cell count because it is the immune marker most closely linked to the clinical consequences of HIV infection. We found no relationships between the independent variables and immune status or illness stage. The HIV-positive men who were depressed or distressed or who reported more life stressors had no greater immunosuppression or more advanced illness stage than did the others. either concurrently or across occasions. We did find a suggestive pattern of association between depressive disorders. distress. and stressors and the number of HIV-related symptoms. which warrants further study.',\n",
       " '10, Multidisciplinary baseline assessment of homosexual men with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection. III. Neurologic and neuropsychological findings, We explored the possibility that neurologic and neuropsychological changes constitute the earliest detectable manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Without knowledge of HIV status. we assessed neurologic signs and symptoms and administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 208 homosexual men. of whom 84 were HIV negative. 49 were HIV positive and asymptomatic. 29 were mildly symptomatic. and 46 had significant medical symptoms but not the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. There was no difference between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive men in the frequency of neurologic signs or of defective or borderline performance on any neuropsychological test. However. HIV-positive men performed slightly but significantly worse than HIV-negative men on tests of verbal memory. executive function. and language. Similar results were obtained when comparisons were limited to HIV-positive medically asymptomatic and HIV-negative men. There was no degradation of neurologic status or neuropsychological performance across stages of HIV severity. but neurologic and neuropsychological summary scores correlated with CD4/CD8 ratios in the HIV-positive group. Ratings of neurologic signs and symptoms correlated with neuropsychological summary scores in the HIV-positive group only. Cognitive complaints were more frequent in the HIV-positive men; they correlated with actual test performance in the HIV-positive but not HIV-negative men. The constellation of subjective and objective neuropsychological and neurologic findings suggests the possibility of a definable syndrome associated with HIV infection in asymptomatic individuals.',\n",

Standardized clinical assessment of current and lifetime psychopathology, Despite numerous reports of the psychiatric consequences of human immunodeficiency virus infection. few reports describe systematic diagnostic assessments of people with human immunodeficiency virus infection. We studied the results of standardized clinical assessments of current and lifetime psychopathology in a large group of homosexual men whose serologic status was known. Results indicated low rates of current mental disorders but very high rates of lifetime major depression and alcohol and other psychoactive substance abuse and dependence disorders. Measures of severity of psychopathology and functioning also indicated. on the whole. good current functioning. No significant relationship was found between stage of medical illness or immune status and any measure of psychiatric disturbance.',\n",

A silicone T tube is pulled into the trachea with a catheter that is inserted into the tracheostomy stoma. advanced through the stenotic subglottic space. and pulled out the mouth. A cone-shaped dilator is placed beforehand at the proximal end of the vertical limb of the T tube to facilitate the passage of that end through the stenotic subglottic space. This method was used in 4 patients with good results. We suggest this technique be tried when attempts to insert a T tube by the usual method fail. as it can be performed under local anesthesia without special instruments and is technically easy.',\n",

Subjects were evaluated using five standardized distress measures at entry and 3 months later. Among the 204 human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative subjects. mean distress measures decreased significantly after all three interventions without differential treatment effects. Among the 103 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive subjects. mean distress measures decreased significantly after the stress prevention training and did not significantly increase in the other two interventions. We conclude that stress prevention training is particularly helpful after notification of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity.',\n",

The group with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome performed significantly worse than the control subjects on the tests measuring concentration. memory. and psychomotor speed. The group with human immunodeficiency virus performed significantly worse than the control subjects on the tests measuring verbal memory and psychomotor speed. On the other tests. their results varied. The study supports the hypothesis that not only patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but also asymptomatic subjects with human immunodeficiency virus may be neuropsychologically impaired early in the course of the disease.',\n",
       " '10, Pre-trigeminal neuralgia, Eighteen patients who subsequently developed typical trigeminal neuralgia experienced a prodromal pain termed \"pre-trigeminal neuralgia.\" These patients described their prodromal pain as a toothache or sinusitis-like pain lasting up to several hours. sometimes triggered by jaw movements or by drinking hot or cold liquids. Typical trigeminal neuralgia developed a few days to 12 years later. and in all cases affected the same division of the trigeminal nerve. Six additional patients experiencing what appeared to be pre-trigeminal neuralgia became pain-free when taking carbamazepine or baclofen. Recognition of pretrigeminal neuralgia makes it possible to relieve the pain with appropriate medications and avoid unnecessary irreversible dental procedures.',\n",
       " '18, The prevalence and risk factors associated with the onset of diabetic nephropathy in juvenile-onset (insulin-dependent) diabetics diagnosed under the age of 17 years in Leicestershire 1930-1985, The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy was studied in a population of 847 juvenile-onset (insulin-dependent) diabetics diagnosed under the age of 17 years who attended diabetic clinics in Leicestershire between 1930 and 1985. Seven hundred and eighty-nine patients (93.2 per cent) were traced. Eight patients with non-diabetic proteinuria and four classified as maturity-onset diabetics of the young were excluded from further analysis. The mean age at onset was 9.3 +/- 4.2 years (mean +/- SD) and the mean duration of diabetes 17.0 +/- 10.6 years (range 3-63 years). Overall. 28 patients (3.6 per cent) developed persistent proteinuria and 39 patients (five per cent) intermittent proteinuria. End-stage renal failure developed in eight patients. In patients with diabetes of 20 years duration (n = 254) the prevalence of persistent proteinuria was 9.1 per cent and of intermittent proteinuria. 7.9 per cent. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were elevated in diabetics with persistent proteinuria compared to patients without proteinuria (154/89 +/- 27/15 vs 123/76 +/- 15/9 mm Hg mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001). Systolic blood pressure was also raised in patients with intermittent proteinuria (133/77 +/- 17/12. p less than 0.005). In addition. proteinuria (intermittent and persistent) was significantly associated with the use of once-daily insulin therapy in childhood and poor clinic attendance. This study suggests that twice-daily insulin therapy from diagnosis in childhood and regular contact with the diabetic clinic decreased the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in this population.',\n",

South Africa. no case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was reported from this region prior to 1982. A retrospective study was therefore made over the six-year period 1982-1987 of 18 patients who presented to the King Edward VIII teaching hospital. Durban. with clinical and laboratory features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The majority of patients (66 per cent) were between 8 and 12 years of age. The mean age of onset was 9.3 years. the youngest patient being four years nine months and the oldest 14 years. The male to female ratio was 1.25:1. A previous history of primary measles infection was obtained in 44.4 per cent of cases; 62.5 per cent occurred before the second birthday. The commonest mode of presentation was personality. intellectual and behaviour disorders (83 per cent) followed by myoclonic seizures (61 per cent) and choreiform movements (28 per cent). Measles antibody was present in the CSF in all cases. The EEG was abnormal in all recorded cases with pathognomonic periodic complexes being found in 56.2 per cent. Confirmation of the diagnosis was provided by brain biopsy in two cases and by necropsy in one case. The findings of this study suggest that subacute sclerosing panencephalitis may not be as uncommon in Black children as has hitherto been thought.',\n",
       " \"19, Studies on the pathogenesis of hypertension in Cushing's disease and acromegaly, The pathogenesis of the hypertension associated with Cushing's syndrome and with acromegaly is poorly understood. We have investigated the possible roles of sodium retention. activation of the renin-angiotensin system and increased sympathetic nervous system activity in untreated patients. In 11 patients with Cushing's disease. seven of whom were hypertensive. total exchangeable sodium was normal despite increased levels of the mineralocorticoid hormones. 11-deoxy-corticosterone and corticosterone. The renin-angiotensin system was also normal. Cardiac sensitivity to the beta-receptor agonist isoprenaline was increased. but this was not due to an increase in beta-adrenoceptor density. Hypertension in Cushing's disease is neither sodium-dependent nor angiotensin II-mediated. but increased cardiac sensitivity to catecholamines. by increasing cardiac output. may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. In nine patients with acromegaly (three of whom were hypertensive) total exchangeable sodium was elevated. Although no correlation between blood pressure and exchangeable sodium was found. hypertension in acromegaly is probably sodium dependent. No evidence was found for a pathogenetic role for either the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone or the sympathetic nervous system.\",\n",
       " '17, The source and significance of raised serum enzymes in rheumatoid arthritis, Hepatobiliary dysfunction in rheumatoid arthritis has been suggested on the basis of raised serum activity of alkaline phosphatase. 5-nucleotidase. lactic dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. but a specific pathological lesion has not been demonstrated and serum transaminases and bilirubin are almost invariably normal. This paper reports a series of studies designed to determine the tissues of origin of the enzymes and offers an alternative interpretation of the enzymological findings. The results suggest that only alkaline phosphatase originates from the liver. while lactic dehydrogenase and 5-nucleotidase originate from synovial fluid polymorphs and synovial lining cells. respectively. Serum alkaline phosphatase may be induced by inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 because it correlates with the acute phase response. Serum lactic dehydrogenase is an integrated measure of polymorph lysis in all joints and offers a marker of joint inflammation more specific than measures such as the ESR. Levels of serum 5-nucleotidase provide information about the activity of the synovium. Finally. because hepatic necrosis does not normally occur. the transaminases may be used to monitor drug toxicity.',\n",
       " '14, Endocarditis in the 80s in a general hospital in Auckland, New Zealand, The clinical and investigative features of 102 episodes of infective endocarditis were analysed retrospectively. The most frequent presenting symptoms (malaise. fever. sweats. myalgia. weight loss) were non-specific. Fever. cardiac murmur. tachycardia. vascular phenomena and a change in mental state were the most common physical signs at admission. Anaemia was present in half the episodes and renal and liver dysfunction in about one-third. Streptococci (61) and staphylococci (31) were the causative organisms in all but 10 episodes. The commonest predisposing factors were underlying cardiac disease (52 per cent) and a preceding focus of infection (14.6 per cent). Left ventricular failure (33 per cent) and focal neurological disease (29 per cent) occurred frequently. Valvular surgery was performed in 20 episodes. with two in-hospital deaths. Overall hospital mortality was 27.5 per cent and death was most commonly neurological (11/28). A higher mortality was associated with elevated total white blood count. microscopic haematuria. renal or liver dysfunction at admission. S. aureus endocarditis. the development of left ventricular failure or focal neurological disease. age greater than or equal to 60 years and persistence of fever after one week of antibiotic therapy. The absence of both renal dysfunction at admission and subsequent microscopic haematuria identified a group with a very low hospital mortality (4.7 per cent). The three-year mortality of the entire group was 43.5 per cent.',\n",

All these results are significant (p less than 0.05) by the chi 2 test with Yates' correction. The presence of two or more of these discriminating physical signs has a positive predictive value of 75 per cent. and a negative predictive value of 99.5 per cent for the diagnosis of tamponade. Clinical diagnosis of tamponade by primary health care personnel in Malawi should be possible. and lead to earlier treatment.\",\n",
       " \"8, Double-blind randomized study of prolonged higher-dose oral amoxycillin in purulent bronchiectasis, Thirty-eight patients with bronchiectasis and daily expectoration of purulent sputum despite conventional antibiotic courses were randomly allocated to receive a sachet of amoxycillin (3 g) or matched placebo twice daily for 32 weeks in a double-blind study. Nine patients (four amoxycillin. five placebo) were withdrawn from the study treatment; the response of the two patients (both on amoxycillin) withdrawn within the first six weeks was not assessed. The pretreatment characteristics of the two groups were similar. Independent assessment of overall response based on patients' diary cards showed that a higher proportion improved in the amoxycillin group (11 of 17) than in the placebo group (four of 19; p = 0.02). Patients in the amoxycillin group spent significantly less time confined to bed and away from work during treatment. The frequency of exacerbations during the study treatment phase was similar in the two groups but they were less severe than before study treatment in the amoxycillin group. There was a greater reduction in purulent sputum volume between exacerbations during the study treatment in the amoxycillin group to 20 per cent of pretreatment volume than in the placebo group (88 per cent of pretreatment volume. p = 0.008). although the concentrations of Haemophilus spp. in sputum between exacerbations was similar in the two groups. Adverse effects experienced were minor except in one patient (amoxycillin) withdrawn after developing a rash and in six patients (three amoxycillin. three placebo) who had diarrhoea lasting more than one week necessitating withdrawal of two patients (one amoxycillin. one placebo) from study treatment. Sputum and stool cultures collected regularly during the study showed no important changes in the bacterial flora in either group. Prolonged higher-dose antibiotic therapy in these patients with severe purulent bronchiectasis significantly reduced the host (patient) inflammatory response to colonizing microorganisms and reduced morbidity.\",\n",
       " '18, Defect in thermoregulation in malnutrition reversed by weight gain. Physiological mechanisms and clinical importance, Previous studies in infants and in the elderly have shown that a low body weight is associated with a defect in thermoregulation and an increased risk of hypothermia. In the present study. thermoregulatory responses to a cooling stimulus were measured in 10 young and middle-aged patients who lost at least 10 per cent of their body weight during illness. Investigations were performed before and after restoration of body weight (mean weight gain 7.2 kg. SE 1.2 kg. p less than 0.001). The cooling stimulus was provided by a special suit perfused with water at 28 degrees C and then at 23 degrees C. Before weight gain. there was no increase in metabolic rate in response to cooling. despite a fall in core temperature. Following weight gain. the thermogenic response to cooling was restored towards normal. Peripheral vasoconstriction. the principal mechanism for heat conservation. was similar before and after weight gain. The thermogenic response to an infusion of adrenaline (25 ng/kg/min) was not abolished by weight loss. suggesting that the defect in cold-induced thermogenesis following weight loss is due to a change in central control mechanisms of thermoregulation. and not to tissue unresponsiveness. The phenomenon of abnormal thermoregulation following weight loss and the return to normal with subsequent weight gain may be clinically important. particularly in the elderly. since quite small falls in core temperature may impair both neuromuscular coordination and cerebral function.',\n",
       " '2, A measles outbreak at a college with a prematriculation immunization requirement, BACKGROUND. In early 1988 an outbreak of 84 measles cases occurred at a college in Colorado in which over 98 percent of students had documentation of adequate measles immunity (physician diagnosed measles. receipt of live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday. or serologic evidence of immunity) due to an immunization requirement in effect since 1986. METHODS. To examine potential risk factors for measles vaccine failure. we conducted a retrospective cohort study among students living in campus dormitories using student health service vaccination records. RESULTS. Overall. 70 (83 percent) cases had been vaccinated at greater than or equal to 12 months of age. Students living in campus dormitories were at increased risk for measles compared to students living off-campus (RR = 3.0. 95% CI = 2.0. 4.7). Students vaccinated at 12-14 months of age were at increased risk compared to those vaccinated at greater than or equal to 15 months (RR = 3.1. 95% CI = 1.7. 5.7). Time since vaccination was not a risk factor for vaccine failure. Measles vaccine effectiveness was calculated to be 94% (95% CI = 86. 98) for vaccination at greater than or equal to 15 months. CONCLUSIONS. As in secondary schools. measles outbreaks can occur among highly vaccinated college populations. Implementation of recent recommendations to require two doses of measles vaccine for college entrants should help reduce measles outbreaks in college populations.',\n",

       " '14, Effect of 21-aminosteroid U-74006F on lipid peroxidation in subarachnoid clot, The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of U-74006F on malondialdehyde (a by-product of lipid peroxidation) in subarachnoid clot. Eighteen cynomolgus monkeys were divided into three groups of six each. There were two U-74006F-treated groups. receiving doses of 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg. and a placebo-treated group. Each monkey underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by right-sided craniectomy and placement of subarachnoid clot around the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Treatment was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days. Seven days after the experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). angiography was repeated and the animals were killed. In the placebo-treated group. significant vasospasm occurred in the MCA on the side of the clot (p less than 0.01). After U-74006F treatment at both dosages. significantly less vasospasm developed in the clot-side MCA (p less than 0.01). The content of malondialdehyde was measured by both the thiobarbituric acid test and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Comparing the two methods. HPLC proved to be more accurate than the thiobarbituric acid test. especially for measurement of low concentrations of malondialdehyde. In the placebo-treated group. the malondialdehyde content was significantly increased in the Day 7 clot (p less than 0.05). In contrast. malondialdehyde content in freshly prepared clot was very low. In the 0.3-mg/kg U-74006F group. the malondialdehyde content of clot was significantly less at Day 7 compared to clot from the placebo-treated group (p less than 0.05). Although the malondialdehyde content of clot from the 1.0 mg/kg U-74006F-treated group was less than that of placebo. it was not significantly so. Malondialdehyde was not detected in the actual vessel wall of the MCA of any group. These results suggest that lipid peroxidation in subarachnoid clot may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm and that the salutary effects of U-74006F in vasospasm may be mediated by a reduction of lipid peroxidation in SAH.',\n",

Longitudinal studies of adult drinking have typically excluded or sampled only small numbers of problem drinking women. and have measured a limited range of influences on women's drinking behavior. METHODS. To study the development of women's problem drinking over time. five-year follow-up interviews were conducted with two groups of respondents from a 1981 national survey of women's drinking: 143 problem drinkers and 157 nonproblem drinkers. Regression analyses examined effects of 1981 predictors on six measures of 1986 problem drinking. for problem drinkers and nonproblem drinkers separately. RESULTS. Among 1981 nonproblem drinkers. predictors of onset of problem drinking indicators by 1986 included younger age. cohabiting. and lifetime use of drugs other than alcohol. The most consistent predictor of persistent (chronic) problem drinking was sexual dysfunction; other predictor included being employed part-time or never married. and experiencing recent depression. Divorce or separation predicted lower levels of subsequent alcohol dependance among problem drinkers. CONCLUSIONS. Findings suggest that different personal and social factors predict the onset of problem drinking as compared with its continuation. and point to nontraditional life-style. sexual dysfunction. and role deprivation as potentially important variables.\",\n",

GM-CSF. II-3 and II-6 have a stimulatory effect and several cytokines (TGF-beta. platelet released glycoprotein. platelet factor 4 and interferons) have inhibitory effects down regulating platelet production perhaps as part of an autocrine control loop. Excess platelet production can be clinically characterized as pseudothrombocytosis. thrombocytosis or thrombocythemia; the clinical features and criteria for each are defined. The term thrombocytosis infers its reactive nature and. in the absence of arterial disease or prolonged immobility. it poses little risk regardless of platelet numbers. By contrast. in thrombocythemia. whether primary or associated with other myeloproliferative lesions. significant thrombohemorrhagic events occur.

The authors describe six patients with this disorder who experienced loss of vision 6 to 36 months after neurological surgery and radiation therapy. Of the six patients in the series. two had a pituitary adenoma and one each had a metastatic melanoma. multiple myeloma. craniopharyngioma. and lymphoepithelioma. Visual acuity in the affected eyes ranged from 20/25 to no light perception. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed sellar and parasellar recurrence of both pituitary adenomas. but the intrinsic lesions of the optic nerves and optic chiasm induced by radiation were enhanced after gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) administration and were clearly distinguishable from the suprasellar compression of tumor. Repeated MR imaging showed spontaneous resolution of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement of the optic nerve in a patient who was initially suspected of harboring recurrence of a metastatic malignant melanoma as the cause of visual loss. The authors found the presumptive diagnosis of radiation-induced optic neuropathy facilitated by MR imaging with gadolinium-DTPA. This neuro-imaging procedure may help avert exploratory surgery in some patients with recurrent neoplasm in whom the etiology of visual loss is uncertain.',\n",

The patients were managed uniformly. and treatment included aggressive surgical resections. postoperative staging evaluations for extent of disease. and craniospinal radiation therapy with a local boost. Beginning in 1983. children with MB/PNET were prospectively assigned to risk groups; those with \"standard-risk\" MB/PNET were treated with radiation therapy alone. while those in the \"poor-risk\" group received similar radiation therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy with 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU). vincristine. and cisplatin. The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival rate for all patients treated between 1975 and 1982 was 68%. and 73% when patients who died within 2 weeks after operation were excluded. This survival rate was statistically better for patients treated after 1982 (82%) compared to those treated between 1975 and 1982 (49%) (p less than 0.004). There was no difference in disease-free survival rates over time for children with standard-risk factors; however. there was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate for poor-risk patients treated prior to 1982 (35%) compared to those treated later (87%) (p less than 0.001). For the group as a whole. a younger age at diagnosis correlated with a poorer survival rate; however. this relationship between age and outcome was significant only for children treated before 1983 (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrated an encouraging survival rate for children with MB/PNET. especially those treated with aggressive surgical resection followed by both radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The results strongly suggest that chemotherapy has a role for some. and possibly all. children with MB/PNET.',\n",
       " '4, Interstitial chemotherapy with drug polymer implants for the treatment of recurrent gliomas, Malignant gliomas have been difficult to treat with chemotherapy. The most effective agent. BCNU (carmustine). has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum. To obviate these problems. a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. In this Phase I-II study. 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant. Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively. upon completion of tumor debulking. The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks. Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels. There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself. The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group. 64 weeks for the second dose group. and 32 weeks for the highest dose group. The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation. The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer. Frequent hematology. blood chemistry. and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy. Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe. a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started. The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma.',\n",
       " '4, Characterization of astrocytomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Phosphorus magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy allows noninvasive measurement of phosphate-containing compounds and pH within brain cells. The authors obtained localized phosphorus MR spectra from 10 normal brains. four low-grade astrocytomas. six glioblastomas. four meningiomas. and three pituitary adenomas and found differences in the spectra of each tumor type. Compared to normal brain. the spectra from low-grade astrocytomas showed a significant reduction of the phosphodiester (PDE) peak. Glioblastomas were characterized by a significant reduction of the PDE peak. elevation of the phosphomonoester (PME) peak. and a relatively alkaline intracellular pH. The spectra from meningiomas and pituitary adenomas were markedly different from the glial tumors. Meningiomas showed significant reductions in phosphocreatine.

Although the number of tumors studied was small. there appears to be a characteristic spectrum associated with these different tumor types.

The greatest density of nerves in the bladder from \"control\" patients contained neuropeptide Y. followed in a decreasing order by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. calcitonin gene-related peptide. substance P and somatostatin. Neuropeptide Y- and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive nerves were found throughout the smooth muscle and the base of the mucosa. while calcitonin gene-related peptide-. substance P- and somatostatin-immunoreactive nerves were found predominantly in nerve bundles with a few single fibres at the base of the mucosa. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-. neuropeptide Y- and calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive nerves were also located around blood vessels. In patients with lower motor neurone lesion. there was a decrease in the density of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-. calcitonin gene-related peptide- and substance P-immunoreactive nerves. but there was little change in neuropeptide Y- or somatostatin-immunoreactive nerves. Urinary retention. bladder areflexia and deficient sensation may be directly linked to neuropeptide neuropathy in patients with lower motor neurone lesion.',\n",
       " '20, Human immunodeficiency virus infection of megakaryocytic cells, The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is capable of infecting certain cells of hematopoietic lineage. particularly monocyte-macrophages and T lymphocytes. Recently. the possibility that cells of megakaryocytic lineage are susceptible to HIV infection has been raised. We have characterized infection of the permanent megakaryocytic cell line CMK by HIV in vitro. CMK cells were easily infected by HIV type 2 (HIV-2). producing significant amounts of virus in culture. Infection appeared to be mediated by the CD4 surface antigen on CMK cells. Three different strains of HIV-1 were able to minimally infect CMK cells. suggesting there may be isolates of HIV tropic for megakaryocytes. Infection of CMK cells led to downregulation of the CD4 surface antigen but no discernable change in expression of megakaryocyte-associated proteins glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. These observations support the likelihood that megakaryocytes are susceptible to HIV infection. and cell lines of megakaryocytic origin may provide a useful model to study effects of the retrovirus on megakaryocyte function.',\n",

       " '12, Radio-contrast enhancement of urinary tract stones, Most urologists treating stone disease with any method (ESWL. PCL. URS) have encountered problems of poor stone visualization with fluoroscopy. This difficulty to localize urinary tract (UT) stones or fragments may result in incomplete stone extraction. prolonged surgery and increased risk of recurrence and post-operative complications. We have sought and found means to increase the radioopacity of mineral UT stones by a simple pre-operative perfusion technique. The capacity of radioopacification has first been demonstrated in in vitro incubations of fragments of human mineral stones with aqueous solutions of barium. of the lanthanides and of the two natural actinides. Most of the incubations led to considerable radio-contrast enhancement and heavy metal incorporation. measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis. Dogs with implanted human stone fragments were used as an in vivo model. The UT were perfused through a retrograde pyelic catheter with heavy metal salts solutions. the ensuing radioopacification of the implanted UT-stones was estimated by abdominal radiographies and the metal incorporation was measured on the retrieved stones. Considerable radioopacity enhancement together with heavy metal incorporation was observed for the following elements: Sr. Ba and the lanthanides Gd and Yb. The pathological evaluation of the urothelial linings from animals treated with lanthanide salt showed no toxic effects.',\n",

Presently surgical extirpation is the only form of therapy that can result in cure. Recently management of extensive vena caval involvement has involved the use of cardiopulmonary bypass with circulatory arrest and hypothermia. We describe a technique using a venous bypass pump system (femoral vein to right atrium) for resection of renal cell carcinoma with suprahepatic vena caval extension (type II). which avoids the risks and complications of cardiac arrest and hypothermia but allows for rapid conversion to total cardiopulmonary bypass should the intraoperative need arise.',\n",

       " '12, A continuous intravesical drug delivery system for the rat, We describe a self-contained system for the continuous infusion of drugs into the rat urinary bladder. A reversible model of hydronephrosis is used to prepare one renal unit for nephrostomy tube placement. An 0.8 mm. silastic nephrostomy tube is introduced into the hydronephrotic kidney via a 16 gauge angiocath. The nephrostomy tube is then connected to an Alzet mini osmotic pump which is implanted in a subcutaneous location. The ability of this system to deliver a continuous dose of a test agent into the bladder was evaluated. Pumps were filled with a 1% solution of methylene blue in phosphate buffered saline. Following pump implantation. urinary samples were collected on a daily basis and subsequently analyzed for their concentration of methylene blue. At the completion of the experiment. specimens of the kidney. ureter. and bladder were histologically examined. Results demonstrated an average of 102% recovery of the theoretically delivered dose over a 14-day period. Renal histology demonstrated chronic inflammatory changes at the site of nephrostomy tube placement. No upper or lower tract urothelial changes were identified. This model provides a system for the continuous delivery of drugs in the rat urinary tract and results in no histological alteration to the lower urinary tract.',\n",
       " '12, Cytostatic effects of suramin on prostate cancer cells cultured from primary tumors, Suramin is currently undergoing clinical trials as a chemotherapeutic agent for prostate cancer. The effects of suramin on cultured human epithelial cells derived from normal. benign hyperplastic. and malignant prostate tissues were examined. In serum-free medium. suramin inhibited the clonal growth of prostate cells at a half-maximal dose of approximately 10 micrograms/ml. Growth inhibition by suramin was completely reversible even after 24 hours of exposure. In conjunction. suramin did not alter cellular phenotype with regard to expression of keratins and prostate-specific antigens. Although suramin is reportedly an antagonist of growth factor-mediated mitogenesis. ten-fold excesses of growth factors did not appreciably suppress the cytostatic activity of suramin. In comparison to the activities of other possible chemotherapeutic agents. suramin would appear suboptimal because its inhibitory effects are reversible and it does not induce a terminally differentiated cellular phenotype.',\n",
       " '4, Assessment of the critical level of androgen for growth response of transplantable human prostatic carcinoma (PC-82) in nude mice, The androgen dependent prostatic carcinoma of human origin. PC-82. was used as a model system to investigate the effect of various levels of androgen on the growth of prostatic tumor tissue. Plasma testosterone levels in mice were correlated to tumor growth and intratumor concentrations of testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. PC-82 tumor burden remained stable at plasma testosterone levels of 0.8 nmol/l.. whereas tumor growth occurred at higher levels and tumor regression was observed at lower plasma levels. This critical level of testosterone corresponded with intratumor testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone concentrations of six to 10 and three to four pmol/gm. tissue. respectively. which are significantly above the levels found in castrated non-supplemented animals (3.1 and 1.4 pmol/gm. respectively). This indicates that remaining concentrations of dihydrotestosterone. which amount to two to three times the castrate level. are not stimulatory for tumor growth in the model of the androgen dependent PC-82 tumor.',\n",
       " '4, Immunohistochemical demonstration of keratin in ameloblastoma as an indication of tumor differentiation, Keratin expression was studied immunohistochemically in 27 ameloblastomas using polyclonal antibody against wide-spectrum keratins (TTL) and monoclonal antibodies against lower- and higher-molecular-weight keratins (PKK1 and KL1). respectively. to clarify the tumor differentiation. Reactions with TTL and KL1 antibodies were generally positive in the stellate cells of the follicular or acanthomatous ameloblastomas. Cell nests of the basal cell type were positive for PKK1. On the other hand. the reactions with TTL or KL1 in the plexiform type were generally weak or absent. From these facts. it was concluded that the follicular. as well as acanthomatous. ameloblastoma is liable to undergo squamous differentiation. whereas the plexiform ameloblastoma remains in primitive stage of tumor differentiation.',\n",

Since tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(N-methyl-N'-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are major chemical carcinogens of smokeless tobacco and are known to be responsible for the development of oral cancers in smokeless tobacco users. the combined effects of TSNAs and HSV in cell transformation were investigated. Exposure of cells to NNN or NNK followed by virus infection resulted in a significant enhancement of transformation frequency when compared with that observed with chemical carcinogens or virus alone. This study suggests that TSNAs and HSV can interact together and show synergism in cell transformation.\",\n",

       " '20, IgE-mediated anaphylactic degranulation of isolated human skin mast cells, Isolated human skin mast cells (HSMC) were prepared and cultured overnight before functional and electron microscopic studies. Mast cell suspensions were examined after stimulation with anti-IgE to produce anaphylactic degranulation or examined in buffer-incubated controls. Histamine release was measured in replicate samples. Control. isolated HSMC studied by electron microscopy were well preserved and fully granulated. Although all granule patterns reported for human mast cells were found. crystal granules were the most prevalent. as is true for HSMC in situ. Individual mast cells containing both crystal and scroll granules occurred. Lipid bodies were rare. as in HSMC in situ. Control. isolated mast cells did not express granule changes associated with either piecemeal degranulation or recovery during wound healing in situ; nor were morphologic changes of anaphylactic degranulation present. Spontaneous histamine release was 0% in control samples. Anaphylactic degranulation of isolated HSMC was accompanied by 24% maximum histamine release and characteristically showed extrusion of altered. membrane-free granules through multiple pores in the plasma membrane to the exterior of the cell. Other morphologic aspects of anaphylactic degranulation. as expressed in isolated human lung mast cells. were also present. These events included granule swelling. fusion. alteration of matrix contents. degranulation channel formation. pore formation. and shedding of granules. membranes. and surface processes. The ultrastructural morphology of isolated HSMC and their IgE-mediated degranulation shows some differences from similar studies of isolated human lung mast cells and of human lung and gut mast cells in biopsy samples. These differences include crystal granules as the predominant granule pattern. minor numbers of lipid bodies. and extrusion of granules during anaphylactic degranulation as characteristic for HSMC. By contrast. isolated human lung and gut mast cells have more scroll granules and particle granules. respectively. and more lipid bodies. In isolated human lung mast cells. anaphylactic degranulation is almost exclusively an intracellular fusion event characterized by the formation of complex degranulation channels within which altered granule matrix materials solubilize. In addition to morphologic differences between mast cells of skin. lung. or gut origin. functional differences have also been reported among mast cells of these organs. The ultrastructural morphology of isolated HSMC is identical to that of skin mast cells in biopsy samples. thereby validating the usefulness of this new source of HSMC for correlative functional and morphologic studies.',\n",

A controlled study of 26 subjects with \\'20th century disease\\', Environmental illness is a polysymptomatic disorder believed by \"clinical ecologists\" to result from immune dysregulation brought on by common foods and chemicals. We systematically evaluated 26 subjects who had been assigned a diagnosis of environmental illness. The subjects indicated a strong interest in their diagnosis. were generally satisfied with their clinical ecologist. and were dissatisfied with traditional medical approaches. Subjects reported varying treatments. including dietary restrictions. avoidance of offending agents. and physical treatments. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. we found that 15 (65%) of 23 subjects met criteria for a current or past mood. anxiety. or somatoform disorder compared with 13 (28%) of 46 age- and sex-matched community controls. We conclude that patients receiving this diagnosis may have one or more commonly recognized psychiatric disorders that could explain some or all of their symptoms.',\n",

Study subjects included 2271 women receiving gynecologic care in our student health clinic. Clinical data were collected in a standardized fashion. We identified cell culture--isolated Chlamydia trachomatis from 133 (9%) of 1458 subjects in the derivation set and 73 (10%) of 729 subjects in the validation set. Model variables included a new sexual partner within 2 months or more than one sexual partner within 6 months; cervical ectopy; cervical friability; at least 20 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field in cervical secretions; white blood cells in vaginal secretions; and use of an antibiotic active against C trachomatis within a month.

A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, One hundred fifty-five consecutive patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation by a physician-manned advanced life support unit were randomly assigned to receive nimodipine or placebo at a dosage of 10 micrograms/kg as an intravenous injection immediately after restoration of spontaneous circulation. followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg per minute for 24 hours. No significant difference was found in the 1-year survival rate of nimodipine-treated (30 [40%] of 75 patients) and placebo-treated patients (29 [36%] of 80 patients). Recurrent ventricular fibrillation during the treatment occurred in one patient in the nimodipine group compared with 12 patients in the placebo group. In a post hoc analysis of patients with very long delays in advanced life support (more than 10 minutes). the 1-year survival rate was higher with nimodipine (eight [47%] of 17 patients) than with placebo (two [8%] of 26 patients).

A pilot study of an approach to quality assurance for cutaneous surgery, In 1985 there were more than 40 million visits for ambulatory surgical procedures in the United States. Although benign cutaneous lesions are among the most frequent conditions to receive surgical treatment in ambulatory settings. their treatment is seldom subject to peer review. In this pilot study we assessed diagnostic accuracy and appropriateness of care using information available from the surgical pathology laboratory. We assessed these two measures of physician performance for 527 seborrheic keratoses removed by 133 clinicians affiliated with four different institutions. Overall. a correct preoperative diagnosis was provided in only 49% of cases. Dermatologists had the highest diagnostic accuracy (61% vs 35% for all other physicians). An appropriate procedure for the actual pathological diagnosis was performed in only 50% of cases. Lesions with a correct preoperative diagnosis were more than eight times more likely to receive appropriate care. Our data suggest that many clinicians fail to note a correct diagnosis of common cutaneous lesions before surgical removal. and many patients are treated with procedures that are more invasive than necessary for the final pathological diagnosis. Because the approach used in this pilot study relies on data already available. it has promise as a low-cost method of monitoring the quality of care of ambulatory surgery.',\n",

We used data from two prospective pregnancy studies to examine the relationship between contraceptive use before conception and preeclampsia. The preeclampsia rates among women using barrier contraceptives were not significantly higher than the rates in women using nonbarrier contraceptives or the rates in women using no contraceptives in either study. The odds ratios for preeclampsia in barrier contraceptive users in the two studies were 0.89 (95% confidence interval [Cl]. 0.71 to 1.12) and 0.85 (95% Cl. 0.49 to 1.45) compared with nonbarrier contraceptive users and 0.91 (95% Cl. 0.71 to 1.16) and 0.81 (95% Cl. 0.48 to 1.35) compared with women using no contraceptives. After adjusting for other risk factors. we found no association between preeclampsia and barrier contraceptive use. Additional studies are needed to resolve this issue; however. we would recommend that women not be advised to avoid barrier contraceptives unless more data linking their use to preeclampsia appear.',\n",

We present a literature review of seven other cases of acute voluntary water intoxication in patients without chronic psychiatric or neurologic illness. For workers undergoing urine drug testing we conclude that risk factors for acute water intoxication include (1) intake of more than 1 L of water and (2) impaired urine dilution. In a recently drug-tested worker. symptoms of cerebral dysfunction should suggest the possibility of water intoxication.',\n",
       " '18, Genetic defects in lipoprotein metabolism. Elevation of atherogenic lipoproteins caused by impaired catabolism, Certain proteins (called apolipoproteins B and E) on the surface of lipoprotein particles are responsible for mediating the binding of cholesterol-rich particles to specific lipoprotein receptors on the surface of cells and represent a major pathway controlling blood cholesterol levels. Three important disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. which provide insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the elevation of specific atherogenic lipoproteins. are the following: (1) Type III hyperlipoproteinemia results from specific mutations in apolipoprotein E that prevent the normal binding of chylomicron remnants and very-low-density lipoprotein remnants to lipoprotein receptors. Patients with this disorder who have elevated levels of these remnant lipoproteins develop atherosclerosis. (2) Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 results from a single amino acid substitution in apolipoprotein B that prevents low-density lipoprotein from binding normally to the low-density lipoprotein receptor and elevates plasma cholesterol levels. (3) Familial hypercholesterolemia. which results in elevated levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein and premature atherosclerosis. is caused by a variety of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor that interfere with the normal binding of lipoproteins to this receptor. These observations not only provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for normal lipoprotein metabolism. but also highlight the potential role of specific lipoproteins in atherogenesis.',\n",

Overwhelming of the peritoneal antiprotease defences by proteolytic enzymes released from the pancreas may be a key factor responsible for this toxicity and is examined in the current study. Human pancreatitis exudates possessed tryptic amidase activity indicating trypsinogen activation. The trypsin inhibitory capacities of exudates were reduced indicating a degree of consumption of the peritoneal antiproteases. Of 21 exudates examined. three showed marked reduction of their trypsin inhibitory capacity indicating almost complete consumption of their antiproteases. All three patients were shocked at the time of sampling. two dying of fulminant pancreatitis within 24 h. Overwhelming of the peritoneal antiproteases was not confirmed. but may occur in a few instances where proteolytic enzyme release or zymogen activation continues. Intraperitoneal administration of exogenous antiproteases prolongs survival in rats with pancreatitis and has been suggested as a therapy in man. The current data suggests that few patients are likely to benefit from such an approach.',\n",

There were 35 normal vaginal deliveries. 36 forceps deliveries. 20 ventouse extractions. ten vaginal breech deliveries and 21 caesarean sections. Sensation was impaired in the lower. mid and upper anal canal immediately after delivery in those patients who had a normal vaginal delivery or a forceps delivery when compared with controls or with those delivered by caesarean section. Women who had ventouse deliveries had impaired sensation immediately after delivery in the mid anal canal compared with controls and those undergoing caesarean section. By 6 months there were no differences between any group. Patients who sustained a division of the external anal sphincter at delivery had impaired sensation which persisted in the upper anal canal at 6 months.',\n",
       " '10, The neck-eye reflex in patients with reduced vestibular and optokinetic function, It is accepted that the neck-eye loop (cervico-ocular reflex. COR) is enhanced following loss of vestibular function and that this helps to restore gaze stability during head movements. In this paper we address the question of which structures and/or mechanisms may participate in such plastic enhancement by investigating the COR in 2 patients with absent vestibular function and reduced smooth pursuit-optokinetic eye movements (SP-OKN). The patients had multisystem atrophy involving the vestibular system and the cerebellum. The COR (elicited by angular motion of the trunk relative to the fixed head and angular motion of the head relative to the fixed trunk) was not enhanced in these 2 patients when compared with normal subjects. in contrast to previous findings in a group of patients with absent vestibular function alone. Measurements of slow phase eye movement velocity during SP-OKN stimuli and during combined COR-OKN stimulation (head oscillation relative to the stationary trunk in the light) showed identical values in these two conditions. which indicates that the neck-eye loop did not contribute to gaze stability during head movements. The absence of plastic enhancement of the COR in these patients may be secondary to interruption of SP-OKN pathways at various possible sites and/or to involvement of the vestibulocerebellum. which is known to mediate adaptive plasticity in the vestibulo-ocular reflex.',\n",

Twelve patients received additional radiotherapy after operation. Of those patients undergoing surgery. three have been lost to follow-up. 17 have died and seven remain alive; the period of follow-up ranges from 3 to 133 months. Fourteen patients remained free of recurrent disease at death or when last seen. and six patients developed a local recurrence at a medium period of 10.5 (range 3-36) months after surgery.

The nuclear DNA content of 65 follicular thyroid neoplasms (52 adenomas and 13 carcinomas) was determined by flow cytometric analysis of paraffin embedded material; in 58 cases preparations were technically satisfactory. In 22 follicular neoplasms DNA analysis was also performed on fresh material obtained by fine needle aspiration of surgical specimens. Cell cycle analysis was performed on both fresh and fixed specimens. An aneuploid DNA profile was found on analysis of fixed tissue in eight of 45 (18 per cent) follicular adenomas and four of 13 (31 per cent) follicular carcinomas. DNA aneuploidy was also found in six of the 22 (27 per cent) fresh preparations from follicular adenomas. The frequency of DNA aneuploidy in apparently benign and malignant follicular neoplasms was similar. Follicular thyroid neoplasia are best regarded as a single entity with a low incidence of local and distant spread. All follicular neoplasia are therefore best excised.',\n",

Total thyroid lobectomy for a solitary thyroid nodule was performed in 68 cases. Each patient had a thyroid isotope scan (except two women who were pregnant) and thyroid ultrasound examination. There were 10 (15 per cent) malignant nodules. 11 (16 per cent) benign neoplastic nodules and 47 (69 per cent) benign non-neoplastic nodules. All of the patients with malignant nodules who were scanned had a solitary cold nodule on thyroid scan. as did 40 (69 per cent) of those with benign solitary nodules. Ultrasound examination of the thyroid suggested correctly that one of 16 (6 per cent) cystic lesions. four of 16 (25 per cent) complex solid-cystic lesions and three of 18 (17 per cent) of solid lesions were malignant. One lesion reported as multinodular on ultrasonography and one reported as normal also turned out to be malignant. Thyroid isotope scans and ultrasound do not accurately differentiate between benign and malignant conditions and their routine use in the investigation of a solitary thyroid nodule should be abandoned.',\n",
       " '10, Neuroacanthocytosis. A clinical, haematological and pathological study of 19 cases, Nineteen cases are described. including 12 cases from three different families and 7 nonfamilial cases. in which multisystem neurological disease was associated with acanthocytosis in peripheral blood and normal plasma lipoproteins. Mild acanthocytosis can easily be overlooked. and scanning electron microscopy may be helpful. Some neurologically asymptomatic relatives with significant acanthocytosis were identified during family screening. including some who were clinically affected. The mean age of onset was 32 (range 8-62) yrs and the clinical course was usually progressive but there was marked phenotypic variation. Cognitive impairment. psychiatric features and organic personality change occurred in over half the cases. and more than one-third had seizures. Orofaciolingual involuntary movements and pseudobulbar disturbance commonly caused dysphagia and dysarthria that was sometimes severe. but biting of the lips or tongue was rarely seen. Chorea was seen in almost all symptomatic cases but dystonia. tics. involuntary vocalizations and akinetic-rigid features also occurred. Two cases had no movement disorder at all. Computerized tomography often demonstrated cerebral atrophy. Caudate atrophy was seen less commonly. and nonspecific focal and symmetric signal abnormalities from the caudate or lentiform nuclei were seen by magnetic resonance imaging in 3 out of 4 cases. Depression or absence of tendon reflexes was noted in 13 cases and neurophysiological abnormalities often indicated an axonal neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsies from 3 cases showed evidence of a chronic axonal neuropathy with prominent regenerative activity. predominantly affecting the large diameter myelinated fibres. Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in 11 cases but without clinical evidence of a myopathy. Postmortem neuropathological examination in 1 case revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis affecting the corpus striatum. pallidum. and the substantia nigra. especially the pars reticulata. The cerebral cortex appeared spared and the spinal cord showed no evidence of anterior horn cell loss. Two examples of the McLeod phenotype. an X-linked abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens. were identified in a single family and included 1 female. The genetics of neuroacanthocytosis are unclear and probably heterogeneous. but the available pedigree data and the association with the McLeod phenotype suggest that there may be a locus for this disorder on the short arm of the X chromosome.',\n",
       " \"21, Frontal dysfunction and memory deficits in the alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome and Alzheimer-type dementia, This study investigated the intercorrelation of 8 'frontal' tests in 32 patients with Korsakoff's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. and examined the relationship of frontal dysfunction to impaired release from proactive interference and impoverished retrieval from retrograde memory. Amongst the frontal tests. there were statistically significant intercorrelations between 3 'fluency' tests and 3 'card-sorting' tests. although the degree of shared variance was relatively low. The relationship of another test--picture arrangement errors--was more equivocal; performance for 'cognitive estimates' was unrelated to performance in the other frontal tests. possibly because it may reflect pathology at a different frontal site. There was no evidence in this study that variability in release from proactive interference was related to measures of frontal function in either patient group. and the conditions under which these patient groups fail to show 'normal' release appear to be tightly constrained. On the other hand. the defective retrieval of retrograde memories was correlated with frontal dysfunction in both patient groups. There was a suggestion of a double dissociation with a measure of nonverbal short-term forgetting. impairment at which was related to the degree of general cortical atrophy rather than frontal dysfunction. A stepwise regression equation based on 3 frontal tests could account for 64% of the variability in retrograde memory performance within the total patient group. 68.5% in the Korsakoff group and 57% in the Alzheimer group. By comparison. the severity of anterograde memory impairment predicted only 21% of the variance in retrograde memory performance. It is concluded that frontal dysfunction produces a disorganization of retrieval processes which contributes to the temporally-extensive retrograde amnesia of these two disorders.\",\n",
       " '12, Evaluation of hemodialysis patients treated with erythropoietin, We evaluated 20 hemodialysis patients who had been treated with erythropoietin (Epo). All patients had hemoglobin levels below 8.5 g/dL. They were randomized to receive either Epo (100 U/kg) or placebo three times per week for 12 weeks. All patients on Epo had a significant (P less than 0.001) elevation of hematocrit levels (19.7% v 35.7%). They also had a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in midweek predialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. 27.8 versus 29.6 mmol/L (78 v 83 mg/dL). and serum phosphorus. 1.8 versus 2.1 mm/L (5.7 v 6.6 mg/dL). Protein catabolic rate also increased significantly (P less than 0.05). No changes were seen in the levels of serum creatinine and potassium. but episodes of hyperkalemia were more frequent in patients on Epo. No changes were seen in patients on placebo. When hematocrit increased. the clearance of blood-water for urea decreased 9%. and the clearance of creatinine. potassium. and phosphorus decreased 15%. Patients on Epo increased both their appetite and protein intake. More frequent episodes of hyperkalemia and elevated phosphorus level resulted from a combination of increased intake and decreased dialyzer clearance. We may need blood-water clearance to calculate Kt/V.',\n",

Hemodynamic parameters in the resting state were determined before and after successful treatment. Posttreatment cardiac index was decreased (3.3 v 2.8 L/min/m2). whereas diastolic blood pressure (72 v 79 mm Hg) and calculated peripheral resistance (2.230 v 2.860 dyne.cm.s-5) were increased significantly when compared with the pretreatment period. We conclude from our study that the increase of blood pressure as seen in patients on dialysis. who are effectively treated with r-HuEPO. is due to an increase in peripheral resistance. This increase overrules the decrease of cardiac index and might well be a result of peripheral vasoconstriction due to improved oxygen availability.',\n",
       " '14, Dialysis-induced alterations in left ventricular filling: mechanisms and clinical significance, Quantitative two-dimensional (2-D) and Doppler echocardiography were used to determine whether hemodialysis results in alterations in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling that might contribute to dialysis-induced hypotension. as well as to assess whether any hemodynamic variables or indices of diastolic filling might be used to identify which patients were at the greatest risk of becoming hemodynamically unstable during dialysis. Sixteen male patients undergoing routine maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease were prospectively studied before and after hemodialysis. Following hemodialysis there was a significant prolongation (P less than 0.05) in LV isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT). as well as a significant reduction in the rate and extent of early rapid ventricular filling (P less than 0.005); in contrast. late atrial-assisted filling did not change significantly. A multiple stepwise linear regression analysis of predialysis hemodynamic parameters and noninvasive indices of LV filling showed that there was a significant independent inverse relationship between the frequency of dialysis-related hypotensive episodes and the duration of early LV filling (r = -0.81; P less than 0.001). These results suggest that hemodialysis results in discrete alterations in early LV filling. with no significant compensatory increase in late atrial-assisted ventricular filling. Further. patients with the shortest early LV filling times appeared to have the greatest predilection for becoming hemodynamically unstable during dialysis.',\n",

The most efficient clinical approach to a patient with anemia is to ask the following three questions: Is the anemia microcytic. macrocytic. or normocytic? Is pancytopenia present?

Answers to these questions focus laboratory evaluation on a logical progression and avoid a costly shotgun approach.',\n",

C5. and properdin (P). Recent studies implicate terminal complement complexes (TCC) in the pathogenesis of glomerular injury. The fluid phase TCC. SC5b-9. reflects the formation of membrane-bound C5b-9 and has been used as a clinical marker in various diseases. Plasma concentrations of SC5b-9 were measured with an enzyme immunoassay using a monoclonal antibody to a neoantigen expressed on the SC5b-9 complex in 13 children who presented with clinical and pathologic features of APSGN. SC5b-9 was significantly elevated in all plasmas obtained within 30 days after onset of clinical glomerulonephritis. Concentrations of SC5b-9 in acute plasmas were significantly higher than those of paired convalescent samples. For individual patients. as SC5b-9 concentration returned to normal there was a coincident decrease in serum creatinine concentration and urinary protein excretion. signifying clinical improvement in glomerulonephritis. Thus. TCC generation commonly occurs in the early stages of APSGN and may be of importance in the pathogenesis of the condition.',\n",

Combined clinical assessment and fistula assessment monitoring were compared with transbrachial angiography. Fistula assessment monitoring was more accurate (96%) than combined clinical assessment (accuracy. 52%) in stenosis detection. Complications of angiography occurred in 17% of patients; there were no complications of fistula assessment monitoring. Fistula assessment monitoring was better than combined clinical assessment in predicting clinical outcome for arteriovenous fistulae over 6 months and was as good as angiography. Routine fistula assessment monitoring could reduce inappropriate angiography and detect clinically significant silent stenoses. It is an ideal method for monitoring arteriovenous access fistulae.',\n",

All of the patients had been injured during athletic activities. Some degree of anterior labral injury was present in thirty-eight of the forty-two shoulders. Half of the patients had generalized ligamentous laxity. The patients were followed for an average of three years (range. two to seven years). Four patients had episodes of instability after the operation. Three had a single episode of posterior subluxation during throwing. one had recurrent posterior subluxation that subsequently was treated by posterior stabilization. and one had anterior subluxation while he was diving from a high board. The average loss of external rotation after the operation was 5 degrees with the arm at the side and 4 degrees with the arm abducted 90 degrees. Satisfaction of the patient was rated excellent for forty (95 per cent) of the shoulders. good for one shoulder. and fair for one shoulder. However. throwing athletes found that they were unable to throw a ball with as much speed as before the operation.',\n",
       " '19, Hypercalciuria in parathyroid disorders: effect of dietary sodium control, Moderate dietary Na restriction (80 mmol/d for 7 days) during constant Ca intake can reduce high urinary Ca excretion to normal levels in idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH). A similar protocol was used to test its effect in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and also in hypoparathyroid subjects (HOPT) during treatment with dihydrotachysterol (DHT). Nine subjects with PHPT. 10 with HOPT. and one with pseudo-HOPT were evaluated after Na-restricted (80 mmol/d) and Na-supplemented (200 mmol/d) diets for 7 days each with dietary Ca constant. Na restriction resulted in a decrease in mean urinary 24-hour Ca excretion in PHPT subjects (10.6 v 7.6 mmol/d [424 v 304 mg]. P less than 0.0001) and in one pseudo-HOPT subject. similar to the pattern seen previously in IH subjects. In contrast. Na restriction was not accompanied by significant change in Ca excretion in HOPT. There was no change in serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) or 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D levels in either group when Na intake was altered. Thus. the presence of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is necessary for sodium-related alterations in urinary Ca to occur. The effect of PTH appears to be \"permissive\" rather than \"active.\" Dietary Na restriction may have a role in the management of hypercalciuria in mild PHPT cases when parathyroidectomy is contraindicated.',\n",

Patients were randomly assigned to a 3-month period of a normal protein diet (NPD. 1.3 mg/kg/d) or of a low-protein diet (LPD. 0.6 mg/kg/d). in a cross-over design. Dietary protein restriction did not affect glomerular filtration rate (47.8 +/- 10.7 and 49.0 +/- 13.5 mL/min/1.73 m2. LPD and NPD. respectively) and renal plasma flow (456 +/- 119 and 499 +/- 161 mL/min/1.73 m2.

LPD and NPD. respectively) and fractional clearance of albumin. IgG. and neutral dextran molecules of graded molecular size (radii ranging from 2.8 to 6.0 nm). These results indicate that reduction of protein intake to 0.6 g/kg/d does not improve glomerular size selectivity in membranous nephropathy. Thus. in current clinical practice. a protein-restricted diet does not appear to be effective in reducing proteinuria in this category of patients.',\n",

Animal studies show convincing evidence of the importance of the enterohepatic circulation. but studies in humans are much less convincing. The importance of the route and the rate of metabolism of ethinyl estradiol are reviewed. Some antibiotics have been reported anecdotally to reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptive steroids. but controlled studies have not confirmed this observation. Although gut flora are altered by oral antibiotics. the blood levels of ethinyl estradiol are not reduced. and one antibiotic at least (cotrimoxazole) enhances the activity of ethinyl estradiol.',\n",

For spinal nerve stimulation. we adapted a monopolar needle electrode inserted deep into the paraspinal muscle. The minimal latency. amplitude. and negative phase area of compound muscle action potential from myotomal muscles were recorded with computer assistance. Abnormality was considered to be significant when the value fell outside of 2 SD of control mean values. Among 17 patients with clinical evidence of radiculopathy. needle EMG was abnormal in 10 patients (58.8%). whereas in the nerve stimulation test the abnormalities were shown in 16 patients (94.1%); in amplitude difference and the abnormal area. differences were shown in 12 patients (70.6%). Among 23 patients with only subjective symptoms of radiculopathy. needle EMG was abnormal in nine patients (39.1%). whereas the abnormal amplitude differences were shown in 18 patients (78.3%) and 15 patients (65.2%) with abnormal area difference by spinal nerve stimulation. respectively. Direct spinal nerve stimulation is recognized as an objective and sensitive test in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy.',\n",
       " '23, Gastrointestinal disease and oral contraception, Oral contraceptive steroids play a major role in modern family planning. With the present tendency to decrease the doses of both estrogens and progestogens. any factor that reduces the bioavailability of the lower-dose preparations may have an impact on contraceptive protection. Although ethinyl estradiol. the most commonly used oral estrogen. is liable to an enterohepatic circulation as unchanged drug. the commonly used progestogens are not. At present. no convincing evidence exists in the human subject that disruption of the enterohepatic circulation by antibiotics or antacids does reduce contraceptive efficacy of the pill. Oral contraceptive steroids are mainly absorbed from the small bowel. and contraceptive efficacy depends on its absorptive capacity. Enhanced passage of gastrointestinal contents or impaired absorption may thus contribute to contraceptive failures in patients who have chronic inflammatory disease. diarrhea. ileostomy. or jejunoileal bypass.',\n",

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, The sensitivity. specificity. and predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of lesions of the rotator cuff. glenohumeral capsule. and glenoid labrum were evaluated in ninety-one patients and fifteen asymptomatic volunteers. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated 100 per cent sensitivity and 95 per cent specificity in the diagnosis of complete tears. and it consistently predicted the size of the tear of the rotator cuff. There was a definite correlation between atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle and the size of a complete. chronic tear of the rotator cuff. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging in the differentiation of tendinitis from degeneration of the cuff were 82 and 85 per cent. and in the differentiation of a normal tendon from one affected by tendinitis with signs of impingement the sensitivity and specificity were 93 and 87 per cent. The formation of spurs around the acromion and acromiocalvicular joint correlated highly with increased age of the patient and with chronic disease of the rotator cuff. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of labral tears associated with glenohumeral instability were 88 and 93 per cent. The study showed that high-resolution magnetic-resonance imaging is an excellent non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of lesions of the rotator cuff and glenohumeral instability.',\n",

The purpose of this article is to illustrate the usefulness of examining these potentials. In addition to an overview of the topic. the article includes a report of a study demonstrating that there were differences between the brain potentials of five patients with traumatic brain injury and those of four healthy control subjects. All five patients were in the postacute phase of hemiplegia. Slow cortical potentials associated with simple goal-directed forearm and finger movements were recorded from frontal and parietal electrodes. Two seconds of movement-related electroencephalographic activity (movement-related potential) were recorded. The patients showed reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their paretic limb and. to a lesser extent. reduced brain potentials for movements associated with their nonparetic limb. The waveforms obtained from the patients were unusual. with uncharacteristic cross-cortical movement-related potential correlations associated with specific electrode configurations. as well as with specific movement conditions. Brain potentials associated with the fore-period interval of a simple reaction time paradigm were later recorded in two of the patients with traumatic brain injury and in a control subject to help determine the functional significance of the relative positivity apparent in their movement-related potential data. This preliminary study indicates that electroencephalographic potentials obtained during the preparation for and execution of movement can provide information regarding the basis for motor dysfunction.',\n",

Whereas the mean weight of uninfected animals increased progressively over 9 weeks. the mean weight of infected animals plateaued at 4-6 weeks and then decreased progressively until death. Splenic mononuclear cells from control hamsters produced 11.3 +/- 8.3 (SD) ng TNF/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. TNF secretion in infected animals was greater than the mean +/- 2 SD of controls in 1 of 3 hamsters at 2 weeks post-infection and in 8 of 9 hamsters at weeks 4-8. The mean TNF secreted by infected animals studied at weeks 4-8 was 371 (range 28-800) ng TNF/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr (P = 0.005). Control hamsters produced 7.7 +/- 2.7 pg IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. At 2 weeks. mononuclear cells from 2 of 3 infected animals secreted amounts of IL-1 greater than the mean +/- 2 SD of controls. All of 8 infected hamsters secreted increased amounts of IL-1 at 4-8 weeks. The mean was 164 (range 17-370) pg IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr (P = 0.002). In comparison to infected animals. mononuclear cells from control hamsters incubated with lipopolysaccharide. 10 micrograms/ml. produced 172.5 ng TNF and 44.6 pg of IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr.

This article reports the results of a descriptive pilot study of the prevalence of herpes genitalis in family practice. The feasibility of obtaining psychosexual information on sexually transmitted diseases from more than 600 patients from five family practice practices was assessed. These initial data show that in the family practices participating in this study: 1) genital herpes is a low prevalence disease; 2) psychosocial adjustment to the disease among infected persons is usually reported as good. apart from sexual effects; and 3) close to 30% of the study population reported having prior sexually transmitted diseases.

Batch N5122) occurred in 139 Jamaican children between January and July. 1988. The overall rate of this complication was 0.95%. The attack rate was 1.92% among the 0- to 6-week age group and 0.6% in the 7- to 52-week age group. Of 139 patients there were 77 males and 62 females and the mean age at presentation was 4 months. The mean size of the BCG scar. duration of healing and Mantoux reaction size differed significantly in patients compared with those of control infants (P less than 0.01). Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from 11 patients. Immunologically index patients and controls differed significantly only with respect to T lymphocyte subpopulation percentages and concanavalin A stimulation indices. Evaluation of the BCG vaccine did not reveal either increased potency or microbial contamination. We conclude that increased susceptibility to the Pasteur strain of BCG might have contributed to the increased incidence of complications in these Jamaican children and hence caution should be exercised in switching one vaccine for another as is often done in the developing countries.',\n",

Nineteen newborns were diagnosed with GBS sepsis between January. 1988. and April. 1990. Case controls (n = 33) were selected from patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for suspected sepsis.

We conclude that a single early complete blood count may not be an adequate screening tool for early onset GBS sepsis and should not be used to rule out infection. Optimal screening for GBS sepsis requires a repeat complete blood count within the first 24 hours of age.',\n",

Maternal and fetal blood samples were obtained in 86 cases and 9 fetuses showed T. gondii infection. Control groups consisted of 30 healthy nonpregnant women and 30 pregnant women. Pregnant women with T. gondii infection showed an increase in the suppressor (CD8) T subpopulation and a significant depression in the total helper (CD4) T cells. These alterations were more important in mothers whose fetus was infected. We showed the progressive maturation of the fetal immune system with a regular increase of all T lymphocyte subsets. Marked alterations were observed in the 9 infected fetuses (depression of CD4 population and lower CD4/CD8 ratio). In the future these differences might be used as a new marker of the severity of fetal lesions and become a useful diagnostic tool.',\n",

Rats were administered carrageenan into one hind paw and saline into the other hind paw. followed by i.p. injection of morphine (0.2-5.0 mg/kg) or saline at 60 min. and testing at 90 min after hind paw injections. Morphine produced a dose-dependent reduction in carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia (17-53%). hyperthermia (39-53%) and edema (24-36%). Morphine treatment did not alter the temperatures of the contralateral saline-injected paws. indicating that opiate suppression of hyperthermia was not confounded by alterations in systemic body temperature or blood flow. The opiate effects on inflammation were stereospecific since levorphanol (1 mg/kg). but not dextrorphan (1 mg/kg). suppressed carrageenan-evoked hyperalgesia. hyperthermia and edema. Pre-treatment with naltrexone (1.5 mg/kg) blocked the effects of a 5 mg/kg dose of morphine sulfate on hyperalgesia. hyperthermia and edema. In a separate study. i.v. injection of morphine sulfate (2 mg/kg) reduced plasma extravasation by 41% (P less than 0.01). Morphine administration resulted in significantly greater increases in paw withdrawal latencies in the inflamed (38-139%) than the contralateral. saline-treated paws (4-19%). The results indicate that opiates exert a moderate. though significant. reduction in the vascular signs of inflammation in addition to their reduction of hyperalgesia. The mechanisms for this vascular effect involve inhibition of both vasodilation (as indicated by a decrease in hyperthermia) and inhibition of vascular permeability. In addition. opiates exhibit enhanced antinociceptive effects in inflamed paws. even when compared to uninjured paws in the same animal.',\n",

First. these agents are not useful in the management of acute gout. Second. all forms of the drugs should be initiated at low dose with gradual increments to achieve a serum uric acid level between 5 and 6 mg/dL. There are no data to support the widely presumed notion that dropping the uric acid level to a very low range (1 to 3 mg/dL) hastens resorption of tophi or improves joint function. Third. the uricosuric agents probenecid (Benemid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane) interact with a number of drugs. and both the patient and physician should be aware of this. Finally. and most important. careful and frequent monitoring is needed during the first several months of therapy with these drugs.',\n",

       " \"10, Use of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms to predict future vulnerability to side effects, OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility to neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes varies widely. even within age and sex subgroups. Individual vulnerability to extrapyramidal syndromes has been assumed to explain this. but the utility of past history for predicting future occurrence of extrapyramidal syndromes has not been studied extensively. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether patients' previous histories of extrapyramidal syndromes predict future episodes of extrapyramidal syndromes and to compare the importance of this predictive factor with patient age. sex. neuroleptic dose. and anticholinergic dose as predictors of extrapyramidal syndromes. METHODS: The charts of 62 schizophrenic patients with multiple neuroleptic treatment episodes were reviewed. Extrapyramidal syndromes. neuroleptic drug doses. and anticholinergic drug doses during the first 21 days of each treatment episode were recorded. RESULTS: Previous extrapyramidal syndromes correctly predicted extrapyramidal syndromes in subsequent treatments for 84% of the patients. Variations in neuroleptic potency. neuroleptic dose. and anticholinergic dose partially explained incorrect predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that patients with a history of extrapyramidal syndromes are at greater risk for future extrapyramidal syndromes. If confirmed. these results strongly support individual susceptibility as a major predictor of extrapyramidal syndromes and indicate that prophylaxis of extrapyramidal syndromes should be considered for patients who have previously suffered extrapyramidal syndromes from similarly prescribed neuroleptic therapy.\",\n",
       " '23, Cognitive and behavioral effects of the coadministration of dextroamphetamine and haloperidol in schizophrenia, OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine if an acute dose of dextroamphetamine might have positive effects on affect and cognition in schizophrenic patients maintained on a regimen of haloperidol and. if so. what variables might predict such improvements. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized on a research ward received a single oral dose of dextroamphetamine (0.25 mg/kg) in a double-blind. placebo-controlled. crossover study. All patients were receiving 0.4 mg/kg per day of haloperidol. Cognitive tests. motor tests. global ratings. mood ratings. and videotape ratings were used to determine the effect of the coadministration of these drugs. Ventricle-brain ratios derived from CT scans were used to predict response to the coadministration of these drugs. RESULTS: Amphetamine improved performance on a measure of concept formation on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test but did not result in changes in performance on tests of memory or attention. As a group. the patients were more active and performed psychomotor tests more quickly while receiving amphetamine. Six patients were judged by clinical raters to have improved in terms of affect. cooperation. and engagement with the environment. Improvement was associated with enlarged cerebral ventricles and increases in blink rate from the placebo to the active drug condition. No patient unequivocally worsened. CONCLUSIONS: These results may be consistent with the theory that coadministration of amphetamine and haloperidol produces relatively selective enhancement of cortical dopaminergic activity. However. because of the acute nature of the trial and the specialized research environment in which it was conducted. the authors do not advocate amphetamine as a routine clinical treatment of schizophrenia.',\n",
       " \"10, Sleep disturbances in survivors of the Nazi Holocaust, OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: Sleep disturbances are commonly reported by victims of extraordinary stress and can persist for decades. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that survivors of the Nazi Holocaust would have significantly more and different sleep problems than depressed and healthy comparison subjects and that the severity of the survivors' problems would be correlated with length of time spent in a concentration camp. Forty-two survivors. 37 depressed patients. and 54 healthy subjects of about the same age. all living in the community. described their sleep patterns over the preceding month on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. a self-rating instrument that inquires about quality. latency. duration. efficiency. and disturbances of sleep. use of sleep medication. and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The survivors had significantly greater sleep impairment than the healthy comparison subjects. as measured by all subscales of the index. but had less impairment than the depressed patients except on the sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction subscales. However. for specific items within these subscales. survivors had significantly more frequent awakenings due to bad dreams and had less loss of enthusiasm than the depressed subjects. Sleep disturbances and frequency of nightmares were significantly and positively correlated with the duration of the survivors' internment in concentration camps. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that for some Holocaust survivors. impaired sleep and frequent nightmares are considerable problems even 45 years after liberation.\",\n",

METHOD: The 947 patients were admitted to a tertiary-care military medical center. Each patient was interviewed. and abuse history. DSM-III-R diagnosis. and other characteristics were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of reported childhood abuse was 18% overall: 9% for sexual abuse (with or without physical abuse). 10% for physical abuse (with or without sexual abuse). and 3% for combined abuse. More female than male patients reported abuse. Alcohol use disorders were more common in victims of physical or combined abuse than in sexually abused or nonabused patients. Axis II diagnoses. particularly borderline personality disorder. were more frequent in abuse victims than in nonabused patients. Histories of drug and alcohol abuse were more common in patients reporting physical or combined abuse than in nonabused patients. Suicidality was also more frequent in abused than nonabused inpatients and was noted in 79% of the patients with histories of combined abuse. Combined abuse in women and physical abuse in men were associated with a family history of psychiatric illness. most commonly alcoholism in male relatives. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the need for greater attention to family dynamics. aggressive diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism within the family. and. especially. determination of patients' abuse histories. even if repeated questioning is necessary.\",\n",
       " '18, Rational ordering of electrolytes in the emergency department, STUDY OBJECTIVE: To validate the predictive abilities of a retrospectively developed set of clinical criteria for detecting clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities. using a different patient population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The emergency department of a busy public hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred eighty-two patients on whom the emergency physician ordered serum electrolytes. INTERVENTIONS: The predictive properties of ten clinical criteria were evaluated; these included poor oral intake. vomiting. chronic hypertension. taking a diuretic. recent seizure. muscle weakness. age of 65 years or more. alcoholism. abnormal mental status. and recent history of electrolyte abnormality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty patients (74.3%) had one or more electrolytes outside of the laboratory normal range. but only 143 (14.6%) had clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities. The clinical criteria predicted 135 of the clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities (sensitivity. 94.4%). When the eight \"false-negative\" cases were reviewed. none of the electrolyte abnormalities affected patient outcome. Implementation of the criteria would have avoided unnecessary testing in 233 patients (23.7%). CONCLUSION: Although no set of clinical criteria can eliminate the need for clinical judgment. use of a set of clinical criteria could substantially decrease electrolyte ordering without compromising patient care.',\n",

In such cases. hypercalcemia appears to be the consequence of excessive production of 1.25(OH)2D by the lymphocyte/macrophage line. The authors report a patient with lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma who developed hypercalcemia with extreme elevation in serum 1.25(OH)2D. Therapy with steroids reduced the serum calcium and 1.25(OH)2D levels to normal. Hypercalcemia has not previously been reported in lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma. The distinctive features of this malignancy. and the derangement in the metabolism of 1.25(OH)2D in lymphoproliferative disorders in general. are discussed.',\n",
       " '23, Hemoglobin Montreal: a new variant with an extended beta chain due to a deletion of Asp, Gly, Leu at positions 73, 74, and 75, and an insertion of Ala, Arg, Cys, Gln at the same location, The unstable hemoglobin Montreal with a deletion of three amino acid residues (Asp. Gly. Leu) at positions 73. 74. and 75 of the beta chain and an insertion of four residues (Ala. Arg. Cys. Gln) at the same location was observed in a 7-year-old Canadian boy suffering from a moderate hemolytic anemia. The introduction of an extra amino acid residue and of other changes in the crevice where the heme group is located is the likely cause of the instability of this hemoglobin variant. The above listed changes were detected through analyses of tryptic peptides of the beta-Montreal chain. sequencing of amplified DNA. and hybridization of amplified DNA with appropriate. 32P-labeled. oligonucleotide probes. It is suggested that a mispairing involving the AGTG sequences at codons 66 and 67 and at codons 72 and 73 of the normal beta gene caused a repetition of a 16-bp segment. while a deletion of 10 nucleotides due to recombination or slippage followed by a second short deletion during DNA repair resulted in the modified sequence of the beta-Montreal gene.',\n",
       " '20, Toxicity and efficacy of anti-T-cell ricin toxin A chain immunotoxins in a murine model of established graft-versus-host disease induced across the major histocompatibility barrier, Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was induced across the murine major histocompatibility complex by injecting C57BL/6 (H-2b) bone marrow and splenocytes into lethally irradiated B10.BR (H-2k) murine recipients. An immunotoxin (IT) composed of a pan T-cell monoclonal antibody called anti-Ly1 (the murine homologue to human anti-CD5) was conjugated to ricin toxin A chain (anti-Ly1-RTA) and used to treat recipient mice. In vitro. IT was as active as free RTA. bound selectively. and inhibited T-cell proliferation even in the absence of potentiators. Mice administered anti-Ly1-RTA in vivo during ongoing GVHD. at a dose of 10 micrograms/d for 5 days. showed lower numbers of splenic Thy1.2+ T cells and significantly improved survival as compared with mice given phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or irrelevant control RTA IT. Protection was transient because GVHD and weight loss occurred when injections ceased. Survival could not be enhanced by crosslinking RTA30. a low oligosaccharide-containing fraction of purified RTA. Treatment with anti-Ly1-RTA caused a significant elevation in neutrophils. and higher doses were associated with mild hepatotoxicity. In contrast. infusion of identical doses and schedules of another pan T-cell immunotoxin. anti-Thy1.2-RTA. caused a significant decrease in lymphocytes. but not neutrophils; a precipitous increase in weight; a decrease in total plasma protein (TPP); and an increase in pleural and peritoneal effusions reminiscent of vascular leak syndrome (VLS). Although the toxic effects of anti-Thy1.2-RTA were too severe to show a survival advantage in a GVHD model. histopathologic studies showed a definite anti-GVHD effect. The most significant decline in GVHD as compared with the PBS-treated controls was observed in skin. and to a lesser extent. in liver and lung. To investigate the cause of IT toxicity. anti-Thy1.2-RTA was administered intraperitoneally to lethally irradiated B10.BR (H-2k) recipients of syngeneic bone marrow. These recipients showed the same weight gain. hypoproteinuria. and VLS observed in the GVHD model. Death occurred at higher anti-Thy1.2-RTA doses (30 or 50 micrograms/daily injections administered days 8 through 12 posttransplant). Anti-Thy1.2-RTA had a negligible effect on renal function. but histologic studies showed patchy dropout of the renal tubules. Treatment resulted in pulmonary vascular congestion. but there was no pathologic evidence of liver. brain. or colon toxicity. Weight gain was enhanced by irradiation because nonirradiated normal mice did not undergo such a precipitous weight increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).',\n",
       " '15, Molecular basis of spectrin and ankyrin deficiencies in severe hereditary spherocytosis: evidence implicating a primary defect of ankyrin, While varying degrees of spectrin deficiency have been found in the majority of patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS). a combined severe deficiency of both spectrin and the spectrin-binding protein. ankyrin. has been reported only in two patients with severe HS. To elucidate the molecular basis of these protein deficiencies. we have studied the synthesis. assembly. and the mRNA levels of spectrin and ankyrin in peripheral blood reticulocytes in one of the previously reported probands. Pulse-labeling studies showed that in HS reticulocytes. the synthesis of alpha-spectrin was comparable with control reticulocytes while that of beta-spectrin was increased about fourfold. presumably reflecting increased erythropoietic drive. On the HS reticulocyte membrane. the amount of newly assembled spectrin was reduced to about half of the control values. presumably reflecting a decrease in the synthesis of the spectrin binding protein. ankyrin: the ankyrin synthesis was nearly absent in the cytosol and the amounts of membrane-associated ankyrin were reduced to about half of the normal values. The changes in the amounts of spectrin and ankyrin mRNAs quantitated by slot blot and Northern blot analyses were comparable with changes in the synthesis of these proteins: The alpha spectrin mRNA was within a control range and the beta-spectrin mRNA was slightly increased. while the amounts of ankyrin mRNA were reduced to about 50% of control values. We conclude that the primary defect underlying the combined spectrin and ankyrin deficiency is a deficiency of ankyrin mRNA leading to a reduced synthesis of ankyrin which. in turn. underlies the decreased assembly of spectrin on the membrane.',\n",
       " '15, Variation in hemoglobin F production among normal and sickle cell adults is not related to nucleotide substitutions in the gamma promoter regions, Single nucleotide substitutions in the promoter regions of the A gamma- and G gamma-globin genes have been associated with increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. We wished to determine whether these or other unrecognized substitutions in the gamma promoter regions are responsible for the 20-fold variation in HbF production in sickle cell patients or normal adults. From a random sampling of 250 sickle cell (SS) patients and 125 normal adults. 17 individuals representing the highest and lowest HbF producers were selected for study. All three common restriction fragment length polymorphism beta-globin region haplotypes (Benin. Central African Republic. and Senegal) were found in both the highest and lowest HbF producers with SS disease. Using the polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of the amplified DNA product. we examined the promoter regions of both the A gamma and G gamma genes from -350 bp to +50 bp of the CAP site. No mutations were found in either gamma gene promoter region. We conclude that nucleotide substitutions in the promoter regions (-350 to +50 bp) of both gamma genes are not responsible for the marked variation in HbF production among SS or normal individuals.',\n",
       " '20, Use of leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates for the prevention of refractoriness and primary HLA alloimmunization: a prospective, randomized trial, Compared with conventional transfusion regimes a strong reduction in HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions is obtained when both red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) and platelet concentrates (PCs) are depleted of leukocytes by filtration. Because most of the leukocyte contamination is introduced by transfusion of RBCs. filtration of RBCs appears rational. but uncertainty exists regarding the degree of leukocyte-depletion of PCs needed for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness. We conducted a prospective trial and randomized patients with acute leukemia to receive leukocyte-depleted PCs prepared either by centrifugation (mean leukocyte count 35 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U) or by filtration (mean leukocyte count less than 5 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U). Both groups received RBCs that were filtered after prior removal of the buffy coat. Clinical refractoriness occurred in 46% (12 of 26) of the evaluable patients that were transfused with centrifuged PCs and only in 11% (3 of 27) in the filtered group (P less than .005). De novo anti-HLA antibodies were detected in 42% (11 of 26) patients in the centrifuged group and only in 7% (2 of 27) of the patients receiving filtered PCs (P less than .004). In 8 of 11 alloimmunized patients in the centrifuged group antibodies were detected in the first 4 weeks of transfusion therapy while none of the patients in the filtered group became immunized against HLA antigens during that period. We conclude that for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions from random donors. both RBCs and PCs have to be leukocyte-depleted by filtration.',\n",

Sixty-eight patients (58%) underwent medical treatment and/or splenectomy and 33 (48% of treated) achieved a complete stable remission. At equivalent platelet count the incidence of major hemorrhagic complications was significantly higher in aged (greater than 60 years) than in younger (less than 40 years) patients (10.4% v 0.4%/pt-y. relative risk = 28.9. P less than .01). A previous hemorrhagic event was identified as another major risk factor for hemorrhage (relative risk = 27.5. P less than .0005). while hypertension and underlying disorders had no influence. We conclude that age more than 60 years and a previous history of bleeding are major risk factors for severe hemorrhages in adults with ITP.',\n",

After transplant. one patient had serologic evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation whereas three patients had evidence of an immune response to HBV. Among four patients with serologic follow-up of 1 year or more. three remained positive for HBsAg and one became HBsAg negative. Six patients (30%) developed clinical evidence of venocclusive disease and seven patients (35%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease involving the liver. but the incidence of these complications was similar to that expected among patients who are not carriers of HBsAg. Three patients died with hepatorenal failure. but all three had venocclusive disease and the contribution of HBV infection to liver failure was unclear. Available liver specimens obtained at autopsy (six patients) or biopsy (two patients) all showed either HBsAg (one specimen) or hepatitis B core antigen (four specimens) or both (three specimens) by immunoperoxidase staining. Although HBV reactivation leading to hepatic failure has been reported among allogeneic marrow transplant recipients as well as other immunocompromised patients. we did not observe an increase in the incidence of severe liver disease after transplant among these 20 patients positive for HBsAg at the time of transplant. and do not consider positivity for HBsAg to be a contraindication to allogeneic marrow transplantation.',\n",
       " '4, Queuine, a tRNA anticodon wobble base, maintains the proliferative and pluripotent potential of HL-60 cells in the presence of the differentiating agent 6-thioguanine, 6-Thioguanine (6-TG)-induced differentiation of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (IMP: pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase. EC 2.4.2.8)-deficient HL-60 cells is characterized by 2 days of growth. after which morphological differentiation proceeds. Addition of the tRNA wobble base queuine. in the presence of 6-TG. maintains the proliferative capability of the cells. The ability of 6-TG to induce differentiation correlates with c-myc mRNA down-regulation. but queuine has no effect on this parameter. Treatment with 6-TG for 2-3 days commits HL-60 cells to granulocytic differentiation. and. once committed. these cells do not respond to the monocytic inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Nonetheless. when cells are treated with queuine and 6-TG. they maintain the promyelocytic morphology and are capable of being induced down the monocytic pathway by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as indicated by stabilization of c-fms mRNA and cell adherence. In the absence of queuine. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is incapable of inducing monocytic markers in the 6-TG-treated cells. The data presented indicate that 6-TG-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is a tRNA-facilitated event and that the tRNA wobble base queuine is capable of maintaining both the proliferative and pluripotent potential of the cells.',\n",

Review of 50 years' experience in Leiden University Hospital, Six hundred and seventy one patients (52.5% women) with Crohn's disease seen at Leiden University Hospital between 1934 and 1984 were identified. Follow up was 98.2% complete. Sixty four (9.7%) of the 659 patients died. The cause of death was related to Crohn's disease in 34 patients. probably related to the disease in four. and unrelated. from incidental causes. in 25. The cause of death could not be identified in one patient. There was a significant decrease of deaths related to the disease after 1973. Causes of death such as amyloidosis and malnutrition have disappeared and postoperative deaths have decreased. The standardised mortality ratio showed an excess mortality of 2.23 for all patients. It was higher for women (3.30) than for men (1.76). A comparison of two recent 10 year periods showed a significant decrease in standardised mortality ratio in men but not in women. Patients whose disease started before the age of 20 years had an excess mortality compared with older patients. This study supports the view that the prognosis of Crohn's disease has improved in general but high quality medical and surgical management is important particularly for younger patients.\",\n",
       " '10, Effects of lactulose and lactitol on protein digestion and metabolism in conventional and germ free animal models: relevance of the results to their use in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy, Protein digestion and metabolism have been studied in laboratory rats and miniature pigs to investigate the mechanisms of action of lactulose and lactitol when used in the treatment of patients with portosystemic encephalopathy. Lactulose (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-fructofuranose) and lactitol (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucitol) increased the excretion of nitrogenous material in the faeces and decreased nitrogen excretion in the urine in a similar degree to that reported for human patients. In studies with germ free rats given lactulose no such effect was observed. suggesting that. for lactulose at least. these effects are mediated by the gut flora. Measurement of the alpha-. epsilon-diaminopimelic acid content of the faeces confirmed that the enhancement of faecal nitrogen was due to an increased contribution from bacteria. The similarity in the results for lactulose and lactitol suggests that. from the perspective of protein metabolism. lactitol acts in a similar way to lactulose in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy.',\n",

Outcome and anorectal function were compared with nine faecal incontinent patients who received medical therapy alone. Three month follow up showed that 50% of patients in the biofeedback plus conventional treatment group and 56% of those treated conventionally only had improved. One year follow up showed that 13% in the biofeedback group were free of soiling and an additional 25% had improved. The results were similar in the conventionally treated group--11% were free of soiling and an additional 44% improved. Anal pressures at rest and squeeze. the rectal distension volume that induced sustained inhibition of both the external and internal anal sphincter. and continence to rectally infused saline were significantly reduced in both groups of patients compared with controls (p less than 0.05). Biofeedback treatment had no effect on these abnormal anorectal functions in either patients who improved or those who did not. The improvement in faecal incontinence was probably due to medical intervention or regression of symptoms with time. or both. and not the result of biofeedback training.',\n",

The total lipid concentration of the puncture bile samples was mean (SD) 11.9 (4.7) g/dl. significantly higher than the endoscopic bile samples (3.9 (3.3) g/dl. p less than 0.001). Total bile acids. phospholipids. and biliary cholesterol (expressed in mol%) and cholesterol saturation index showed no significant differences between the two types of samples. The glycocholic acid concentration in the endoscopically obtained bile (27.7 (6.6) mol% v 23.3 (5.4) mol%; p less than 0.01) was significantly higher than the puncture bile samples. Puncture bile exhibited a significantly shorter nucleation time (3.5 (3.3) days v 19.6 (11.9) days; p less than 0.001). For determination of the nucleation time. endoscopic bile aspiration after gall bladder stimulation with ceruletid led to adequately concentrated samples in 50% of the study subjects. Cholesterol monohydrate crystal formation in native bile was observed in six samples of puncture bile and in three samples of the endoscopically obtained bile. The presence of cholesterol crystals and the determination of nucleation time in the puncture bile were the best discriminants between cholesterol and pigment gall stones and correlated well with computed tomogram analysis.',\n",

The patients were assigned randomly to receive continuous subcutaneous infusion of either octreotide. 300 micrograms/24 h (five patients) or placebo (six patients) for 12 weeks. At baseline. mean glomerular filtration rate and mean total kidney volume were not significantly different in the two groups. However. after 12 weeks of treatment. the mean glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in the octreotide group (136 mL/min per 1.73 m2; range. 91 to 158 mL/min per 1.73 m2) than in the placebo group (157 mL/min per 1.73 m2; range. 138 to 184 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Furthermore. the mean total kidney volume was significantly lower after treatment in the octreotide group (379 mL/1.73 m2; range. 307 to 454 mL/1.73 m2) than in the placebo group (389 mL/1.73 m2; range. 347 to 465 mL/1.73 m2). Glycemic control did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that subcutaneous infusion of octreotide for 12 weeks reduces increased glomerular filtration rate and kidney size in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus despite the fact that glycemic control remains unchanged.',\n",

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Six medical intensive care units in a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-two autopsied patients of the 401 veterans who received mechanical ventilation and died in the hospital. RESULTS: The class I error rate was 12%. Abdominal pathologic conditions--abscesses. bowel perforations. or infarction--were as frequent as pulmonary emboli as a cause of class I errors. While patients with abdominal pathologic conditions generally complained of abdominal pain. results of examination of the abdomen were considered unremarkable in most patients. and the symptom was not pursued. Six percent of patients had extensive malignant neoplasms (class IIB errors). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical presentation of potentially treatable abdominal pathologic conditions is a common cause of class I errors in veterans who receive mechanical ventilation. Conversely. several patients with unrecognized terminal conditions underwent intensive intervention. If the information gained at autopsy had been known before death. management would have probably changed substantively in 18% of patients.',\n",
       " '4, Marker profile of different phases in the transition of normal human ovarian epithelium to ovarian carcinomas, To investigate whether early changes in the transformation of normal ovarian epithelial cells into tumor cells can be detected with monoclonal antibodies. a comparative immunohistochemical study was performed on normal human ovarian mesothelial cells. cystomas. cystadenomas. ovarian carcinomas. as well as granulosa cell tumor. Using monoclonal antibodies against different keratin subtypes. it was shown that mesothelial cells. ovarian cysts. cystadenomas. and carcinomas all reacted positively with broad-spectrum anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). as well as with MAbs to keratins 7. 8. 18. and 19. Keratins 4 and 13 were not found in mesothelial cells. but positive groups of cells were identified in several cystomas. adenomas. and carcinomas. While mesothelial cells did not react with the pan-epithelial marker BW495/36. invaginating metaplastic mesothelial cells. inclusion cysts. cystomas. adenomas. and carcinomas showed an increasing reactivity with BW495/36. with an increasing degree of malignancy. The reactivity of MAbs against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OV-TL 3. OC 125. MOv 18. and OV-TL 10) was limited to weak staining reaction in some mesothelial cells but were found to be positive on more than 50% of the ovarian cystadenomas and more than 90% of the ovarian carcinomas. Thecal and granulosa cells of primordial. primary. and secondary follicles all reacted positively with antibodies to the broad-spectrum keratins OV-TL 12/5 and RCK 102. and to keratins 8 and 18. but not with keratins 4. 7. 13. and 19. These keratins decreased or disappeared in granulosa cells of mature follicles (Graafian follicles). whereas granulosa cell tumors did not react with anti-keratin antibodies. The reactivity of BW 495/36 was negative or limited to traces in some granulosa cells. Ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were not expressed in granulosa cells or granulosa cell tumors. The data indicate that mesothelial cells undergoing metaplastic changes finally resulting in ovarian cystadenomas (and carcinomas) initiate the synthesis of a 200-kd glycoprotein recognized by MAb (BW 495/36). the production of ovarian carcinoma associated antigens. in addition to focal production of keratin 4 and/or 13. as seen in several samples. The granulosa cell tumors decrease or switch off their keratin production and remain negative for the 200-kd glycoprotein and the ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens.',\n",
       " '8, Selective differences in macrophage populations and monokine production in resolving pulmonary granuloma and fibrosis, Alveolar macrophages (AM) and their production of interleukin-1-like activity (IL-1) and macrophage-derived growth factor for fibroblasts (MDGF) were examined during chronic inflammatory reactions leading to either granuloma formation or fibrosis. Groups of five rats each received. respectively. a single transtracheal injection of xonotlite. attapulgite. short chrysotile 4T30. UICC chrysotile B asbestos. or saline. One month later. such treatments induced either no change (xonotlite). granuloma formation (attapulgite and short chrysotile 4T30). or fibrosis (UICC chrysotile B). By 8 months. however. the granulomatous reactions had resolved or greatly diminished. whereas the fibrosis persisted irreversibly. Parallel examination of cell populations obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage revealed that multinucleated giant macrophages (MGC) were present in lavage fluids of animals with resolving granulomatous reactions but absent in those obtained from animals with lung fibrosis. Evaluation of monokine production by inflammatory macrophages also revealed significant differences. Enhanced production of IL-1-like activity was seen in both types of lung injury. although especially during the early stage (1 month) and decreased thereafter (8 months). By contrast. augmentation of MDGF production was observed in animals with lung fibrosis only and persisted up to 9 months. Taken together. these data indicate that production of selected cytokines. as well as AM differentiation along a given pathway. may modulate the outcome of a chronic inflammatory response.',\n",
       " '20, Early cellular events in evolving cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in humans, The delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) in human skin is prototypic for many inflammatory dermatoses. However the cellular events that precede gross lesion formation are unknown. In this study. inflammatory cell populations and adhesion molecule expression in early phases of DHR elicited by 2.4-dinitrochlorobenzene were evaluated. The first discernible event (at 1 hour) was mast cell degranulation. followed by induction of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1) expression on dermal postcapillary venules at 2 hours. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule expression peaked at 24 hours and declined by 48 hours. In contrast. endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) remained at constitutive levels. Intrafollicular T-cell migration occurred independent of ICAM-1 expression and commenced as early as 4 hours after challenge. Mature. activated CD4-positive lymphocytes that expressed a helper-inducer/memory phenotype predominated in early lesions. These results demonstrate in vivo that mast cell degranulation. ELAM-1 expression. and memory T-cell-follicular interactions are key events in subclinical evolutionary stages of cutaneous DHR.',\n",

Keratins are widespread but synovial sarcoma contains a distinctive keratin polypeptide pattern and desmoplakins, The presence of individual keratin polypeptides and desmoplakins was immunohistochemically studied in 25 spindle cell sarcomas of different types using acetone-fixed frozen sections. Results revealed that keratins 8 and 18 were present in a high number of tumors: 9 of 9 synovial sarcomas. 5 of 7 leiomyosarcomas. 5 of 5 malignant schwannomas. and 1 of 4 undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. In addition to keratins 8 and 18. the glandular component of synovial sarcoma showed prominent reactivity with antibodies to keratins 7 and 19. Also the glandular epithelial cells in synovial sarcoma showed desmoplakin immunoreactivity preferentially in a luminal distribution. but desmoplakin was absent in other spindle cell sarcomas. Furthermore keratin 13 was seen focally in 4 of 9 synovial sarcomas. In contrast. keratins 7. 13. and 19 were practically absent in leiomyosarcomas. malignant schwannomas. and undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. The widespread presence of keratins 8 and 18 in various spindle cell sarcomas may reflect aberrant keratin expression in mesenchymal cells. previously described in cultured transformed fibroblasts. The presence of keratins 7 and 19 and desmoplakin is highly associated with morphologically observable epithelial differentiation restricted to synovial sarcoma among spindle cell sarcomas.',\n",

Two 24-h recalls were undertaken in 67 of the children aged 72-120 mo; 52%. 73%. and 76% had energy. protein. and zinc intakes. respectively. less than two-thirds of the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations. Stunting was prevalent (29%); 16% were moderately wasted. The prevalence of stunting and hair zinc concentrations less than 1.68 mumol/g was gender related; 38% of males vs 20% of females had Z scores for height-for-age (HAZ scores) less than -2 (P = 0.04); 26% of males vs 11% of females had hair zinc less than 1.68 mumol/g (P less than 0.05). Analysis of variance showed that age. sex. hemoglobin. and log hair zinc influenced HAZ scores. depending on the age group; both sex and the log of the hair zinc values were significant factors in the older children. Stunting in Worsera children was related to chronic deficits in energy and protein and was excerbated in the older male children by suboptimal zinc status.',\n",

Serum anti-SP65 was measured in AS. RA and healthy controls using an indirect enzyme immunoassay with recombinant SP65. IgA anti-SP65 was elevated in 19 of 59 AS patients. but the elevation in median level was not statistically significant. Anti-SP65 of all isotypes was increased in RA. but achieved significance (P less than 0.01) for IgA only. Adjusting specific antibody results for elevations in total serum Ig levels reduced AS and RA anti-SP65 to near normal levels. suggesting that a major component of the increased anti-SP65 may be secondary to polyclonal activation.',\n",

       " '8, A new method of needle-electrode placement in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle for electromyography, In 1979 the authors developed a new method of needle-electrode placement in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA) for electromyography. The PCA muscle is easily reached by inserting a needle electrode through the cricothyroid membrane at the midline and penetrating the lamina of the cricoid cartilage in the subglottic cavity. Access to the PCA muscle for electrode insertion was best afforded by a percartilaginous approach. This report details the new technique used at our laboratory. To our knowledge. this is the first report of needle-electrode placement in the PCA muscle by a percartilaginous approach. This new electrode insertion technique has been applied to more than 100 dogs for research purposes and to 1200 patients with laryngeal motor disorders for clinical diagnosis. This is a simple technique requiring the usual skills. Reliable electromyographic recordings have been obtained by this new method. No untoward effects. such as hematoma or infection from repeated placements were observed in approximately 3200 examinations performed to date. It is reasonable to assume that the percartilaginous route for electrode insertion in the PCA muscle is feasible in man. Techniques of electrode placement in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles are reviewed and compared.',\n",

It is immunologically not related to streptococcal exoenzymes or the streptococcal cell wall and can be detected on the endothelial side of the glomerular basement membrane of kidney biopsies of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (ASGN) during the early phase of the disease. Highest and most persistent antibody titers to this antigen are found in patients with ASGN. Immunoaffinity isolated ESS was injected i.v. into the tail vein of Wistar Furth (W/FU) rats for up to five successive days. The animals were sacrificed on days 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 8. 9. 10. 11 and 12. Frozen sections of the rat kidneys were tested by immunofluorescence against rabbit anti-ESS-antibody and against sera from patients who had recently recovered from ASGN as well as against anti-rat-IgG and C3. The basement membranes of rat kidneys were positive for ESS deposition starting from day one on. but were negative for anti-rat IgG and C3 during the first four days. Rats sacrificed on days 8-12 showed increasing deposition of IgG and C3 with decreased staining for ESS. The sera of rats sacrificed on days 1-3 had no detectable anti-ESS antibodies; whereas animals from day 4 on had low levels of anti-ESS antibodies as determined by microcomplement fixation. Control animals showed no staining for ESS. IgG. C3 as well as no detectable anti-ESS antibodies.',\n",

Results of all hematologic measurements were abstracted from the prenatal and delivery records of 1706 of the 26.901 women in the cohort. Among women delivered of infants at term. mean hematocrit value was low during the early phase of the second trimester. stable until near term. then reached a maximum at 40 weeks' gestation. The mean hematocrit value of black women was consistently lower than that of Asian. Mexican. and white women. Anemia (hematocrit value less than the tenth percentile for ethnic group and duration of pregnancy) at any time during the second trimester was positively associated with subsequent spontaneous preterm birth (odds ratio. 1.9; 95% confidence interval. 1.3 to 2.8). Compared with white women. the odds ratios for preterm birth were 2.0 (95% confidence interval. 1.6 to 2.4) for black. 1.2 (95% confidence interval. 0.9 to 1.6) for Asian. and 1.2 (95% confidence interval. 1.0 to 1.5) for Mexican women. Adjustment for second-trimester anemia had minimal influence on the odds ratios. We conclude that anemia during the second trimester was associated with preterm birth. However. it does not account for the large ethnic differences in preterm birth.\",\n",

Thus less expansive techniques to obtain endometrial samples have been evaluated. but all of them are invasive. The value of endovaginal ultrasonography for identifying endometrial abnormality in this group of women has not been evaluated until now. This study used endometrial thickness as measured by endovaginal ultrasonography as an indicator of endometrial abnormality. It was demonstrated in 205 women with postmenopausal bleeding that if the endometrium was less than 9 mm thick. no endometrial cancer was found at curettage. The mean endometrial thickness in those women with endometrial cancer was 18.2 +/- 6.2 mm as compared with 3.4 +/- 1.2 mm in those women with atrophic endometrium. If the cutoff limit for endometrial abnormality was 5 mm. the positive predictive value for identifying endometrial abnormality was 87.3%.

All patients were followed up with daily fetal biophysical profiles and systolic/diastolic ratios. After delivery. placental pathologic examination for histologic evidence of infection (umbilical vasculitis) was performed in all cases according to a standard protocol. The longitudinal trends of fetal biophysical profile scores and systolic/diastolic ratios were analyzed for patients with and without umbilical vasculitis. Analysis of the longitudinal trend during the period of 2 to 7 days before delivery showed that there were no differences of biophysical scores of systolic/diastolic ratios in either group. However. in the last examination. within 24 hours of delivery. patients with umbilical vasculitis had higher systolic/diastolic ratios and lower biophysical profile scores as compared with previous examinations. In addition. the biophysical profile score of the last examination 24 hours before delivery in patients with umbilical vasculitis was found to be significantly lower as compared with patients without umbilical vasculitis (mean +/- SD. 6.6 +/- 2.3 versus 8.2 +/- 2.4. respectively). These data suggest that subclinical stages of infection are associated with biophysical alterations of the fetoplacental unit (i.e.. simultaneous decrease in fetal biophysical activities and increase in systolic/diastolic ratios). Daily umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios. in conjunction with biophysical profiles. may be useful to follow up patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes.',\n",

The relative risk was greater than 19.28. Human immunodeficiency-positive status was associated with other parameters: lower age and parity. major frequency of induced abortions. and sexually transmitted diseases. Thus although human immunodeficiency-positive status seems to be a true risk factor in relation to the altered immunologic state. an indirect association cannot be discarded. Such patients should be screened closely for human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer. Among human immunodeficiency-positive women. a more resistant behavior of human papillomavirus-associated lesions was detected (recurrence-persistence of 41.7% versus 12%). a fact that might also be in relation to the immunodepressed status.',\n",

In 14 of these cases. pulsating blood velocities were recorded in the umbilical vein. which in a normal population had a nonpulsatile blood velocity pattern. The four cases without pulsations in the umbilical vein were found to have intrauterine viral infections. In the last 10 cases examined. the umbilical venous pulsations were found to reflect abnormal central venous pulsations during atrial systole suggesting increased fetal central venous pressure. Right ventricular shortening fraction was significantly decreased in the group with umbilical venous pulsations compared with those without (0.18 versus 0.32. p less than 0.05). All the fetuses without venous pulsations survived. but only four of the 14 with pulsations survived (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that blood velocity recordings in the umbilical and central veins of the fetus can give valuable clinical information with regard to the presence of fetal congestive heart failure and differentiate between this physiologic state and other causes of nonimmune hydrops fetalis. This may have implications for fetal diagnostic work-up and prognosis.',\n",

MRI is the most accurate method of staging the periprostatic spread of carcinoma. Both the prostate and the regional nodes can be evaluated. The role of ultrasound is. at present. unclear. Second. the utility of CT has diminished with the emergence of high-quality MRI. but in situations in which MRI scans are inconclusive (e.g.. in the assessment of paraaortic node disease. in which images are degraded by peristaltic movement). CT may be useful. Third. the choice of method for the assessment of nodal disease is a more difficult question. Although MRI and CT have replaced lymphography in most centers. the latter study. especially when combined with fine-needle aspiration biopsy. still is useful. Fourth. bone metastases are best assessed with scintigraphy. which can point to areas requiring supplemental plain radiography. An MRI study of the spine. although highly sensitive. is not practical.

In addition. the long half-life of a pure anti-androgen such as Casodex results in maintenance of high serum anti-androgen concentrations. which allays concern over the clinical significance of any small rise in serum testosterone concentrations. The anti-androgen of choice for the treatment of androgen-responsive diseases has yet to be defined. However. this choice should be based on extensive clinical evaluations of a drug as monotherapy. As always. the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the drug will be important factors in determining the anti-androgen of choice; however. favorable pharmacokinetics should be emphasized in the treatment of a disease in which high and sustained concentrations of antagonist must be present to prevent androgenic stimulation. Casodex. a pure anti-androgen with a relatively long half-life. produces objective and subjective responses similar to those of surgical or pharmacologic castration and is well tolerated. Its profile makes it a strong candidate for consideration as the future anti-androgen of choice in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.',\n",

A pilot test among 22 hypercholesterolemic children (whose treatment was limited to diet modification) revealed that children within the 4- to 10-year age range liked the \"talking-book\" approach and identified positively with the story characters. Parents indicated that their materials were clear and helpful. Between the baseline and 3-month follow-up visits. the children exhibited a significant increase in knowledge of heart healthy foods. a decrease in total fat consumption that approached significance. and a significant decrease in plasma low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol values.',\n",
       " '23, Nursing home patients transferred by ambulance to a VA emergency department, Nursing home residents are frequently transferred to hospital emergency departments. Delayed transfer may lead to poor outcomes. However. inappropriate transfer of the frail elderly may cause social and financial problems. We prospectively evaluated 221 consecutive ambulance transfers from community nursing homes to a VA emergency department. The objectives of the study were to describe the process and outcomes of transferred patients and to determine if alternative interventions were feasible. The results indicate that the problems of nearly half the study group could have been treated at the nursing home by a visiting physician with minimal medical equipment. Those admitted to the hospital (52%) were seriously ill. had prolonged lengths of stay (23.6 days). and had a high mortality rate (11%). Complex issues of physician reimbursement. proprietary nursing home budgeting. and day-to-day expediency appear to be involved in decisions to transport patients by ambulance to VA emergency departments.',\n",
       " '18, Is the recommended daily allowance for vitamin D too low for the homebound elderly, A population of sunlight-deprived elderly was studied to determine the daily intake of vitamin D and whether dietary intake was sufficient to maintain a normal vitamin D status. Twenty-two subjects over 65 years old with serum creatinine less than 180 mumols/L and confined indoors for more than 6 months were chosen from the community and a nursing home in Southeast Baltimore. Three-day food records were obtained along with serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1.25-(OH)2 D). and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH). The mean daily vitamin D intake was over twofold greater than the adult Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 200 IU. The mean 25-OHD level was 40 nmol/L (normal 25-138 nmol/L) with seven patients less than 25 nmol/L. Of these participants with 25-OHD values less than 25 nmol/L. the mean vitamin D intake was 467 IU (range 36-1096 IU). We conclude that the current RDA seems inadequate for many older individuals who do not get sun exposure. This particular population of elderly is at risk to develop vitamin D deficiency and the associated complications.',\n",

The patient is observed and timed while he rises from an arm chair. walks 3 meters. turns. walks back. and sits down again. The results indicate that the time score is (1) reliable (inter-rater and intra-rater); (2) correlates well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = -0.81). gait speed (r = -0.61) and Barthel Index of ADL (r = -0.78); and (3) appears to predict the patient\\'s ability to go outside alone safely. These data suggest that the timed \"Up & Go\" test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time. The test is quick. requires no special equipment or training. and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.',\n",
       " '10, Mini-Mental State exam scores vary with education in blacks and whites, Previous studies have suggested that education and race may affect performance on standardized mental status tests. In order to more clearly define these relationships. a prospective longitudinal study was devised to answer two questions: (1) whether race or level of education affects scores on the Mini-Mental State (MMS) exam in non-demented people and (2) what numerical cutpoints maximize the sensitivity and specificity of utilizing the MMS to help diagnose dementia in blacks of varying educational attainment. A total of 100 white and 258 black individuals. recruited from two city hospital primary care geriatric clinics. were evaluated and subsequently followed longitudinally over a 2 1/2 year period in order to assess accurately the presence or absence of dementia. In the non-demented. total MMS scores and performance on each item of the MMS were analyzed. revealing that people with an 8th grade or less education consistently had significantly (P less than .01) worse results than the better educated (9th grade or better) on borough. attention items. recall of table and dog. copying. sentence writing. phrase repeating. and total score. Furthermore. a total of 25% of the lower education group had an MMS score in the 18-23 range. traditionally thought to suggest dementia. There were no consistently significant differences between blacks and whites of equal education. In the better educated groups. using a score of 23 or less to define dementia maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of using the MMS in this diagnosis at 93% and 100%. respectively. In the lower education group. using 17 or less to define dementia maximizes sensitivity and specificity at 81% and 100%. respectively.',\n",
       " '5, Vertebral osteomyelitis, Vertebral osteomyelitis can be caused by a variety of microorganisms. The hematogenous pyogenic form is characteristically a disease of people over age 50. predominantly in the male population. and most frequently caused by S. aureus. In IVDAs. however. younger patients and a heavier predominance of males are seen. and P. aeruginosa is one of the most commonly seen pathogens. The disease is generally monomicrobial. unless it is secondary to a contiguous process such as a pressure sore. in which polymicrobial infection with participation of anaerobes is the general rule. Lumbar. greater than thoracic. greater than cervical involvement is the rule in the general population. but cervical spine involvement is frequently seen more often than thoracic involvement in IVDAs. Diabetic patients are over-represented among patients with vertebral osteomyelitis. and they also have a tendency for higher morbidity and mortality. Simultaneous involvement of adjacent vertebral end plates and the intervening disk is the general rule. The vertebrae are generally involved. and the posterior elements of the spine are involved infrequently. Posterior element involvement is seen more commonly in actinomycosis. coccidioidomycosis. and neoplasms. Newer diagnostic modalities. such as CT. MRI. and radionuclide scans. may detect the disease earlier than conventional radiographs. Immunobilization by bed rest and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are generally sufficient in the therapy of pyogenic. as well as tuberculous. vertebral osteomyelitis. In selected circumstances. such as in the presence of marked instability of the spine. the presence of new neurologic deficits. or with progression of previous neurologic deficits. surgical intervention may be necessary. With prompt diagnosis and proper management. the prognosis should generally be good.',\n",
       " '5, Infectious arthritis, Any patient who presents with an acute monarticular arthritis. especially a new asymmetric effusion with underlying joint disease. should be suspected of having a bacterial process. Because synovial fluid findings (leukocyte counts and glucose) may not be predictive of infection. bacteriologic analysis by smear and culture is necessary in the evaluation of any new synovial effusion. A chronic monarticular process is highly likely to be infectious also. but mycobacterial or fungal etiologies frequently require appropriate culture of synovial tissue in addition to processing fluid. Acute polyarticular syndromes are seen as manifestations of disseminated gonococcal infections (DGI) and certain viral infections in adults. Diagnostic clues include historic and physical findings (exposure history and type of rash). The major pathogen in adults remains Staphylococcus aureus. so initial therapy is directed at this organism unless urinary tract infection is present also. Proper recommended therapy for DGI is ceftriaxone because penicillin-resistant strains are present in many urban centers. Early recognition and treatment of bacterial arthritis may prevent poor outcome. particularly in elderly patients or those with underlying joint diseases. For chronic mycobacterial or fungal infections. surgery may need to be combined with medical management.',\n",

The diagnostic criteria for osteomyelitis remain confusing to practicing physicians. Bone biopsy culture is now the standard for determining specific antimicrobial therapy. Many of the newest and most potent antimicrobials are now used to treat the increasingly broad bacterial spectrum of etiologies of osteomyelitis.

Following a baseline Doppler echocardiographic examination. esmolol was titrated to reduce the rate-pressure product by at least 20%. Once the patients had been receiving a maintenance dosage for 30 minutes. Doppler echocardiographic studies were repeated. Mean esmolol dose at target response was 17 +/- 16 mg/min. with the dosage range of 8 to 24 mg/min. Esmolol was effective in alleviating anginal chest pain in 18 of the 21 patients. Seven patients eventually underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and eight had coronary bypass surgery. The remainder were discharged receiving medical therapy including oral beta-blockade. During esmolol therapy. heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly (86 +/- 14 to 68 +/- 12 beats/min and 125 +/- 16 to 103 +/- 20 mm Hg. both p less than 0.001). Cardiac output decreased from 5.4 +/- 1.3 to 4.5 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than 0.001) secondary to a decrease in heart rate as stroke volume remained unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 47 +/- 12 to 49 +/- 13 with esmolol therapy. although this change was not statistically significant. Both the one third filling fraction as well as E/A ratio (ratio of early-to-late diastolic filling velocities) increased with esmolol therapy (35 +/- 8% to 38 +/- 8% and 0.73 +/- 0.2 to 0.85 +/- 0.23. both p less than 0.005). indicating improvement in left ventricular diastolic function.',\n",

Effect of antiischemic treatment on systolic and diastolic left ventricular wall motion was studied in 35 patients who had unstable angina pectoris and an electrocardiogram that indicated severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery narrowing. Treatment consisted of either a revascularization procedure (17 patients) or antianginal drug therapy (18 patients). All patients underwent a two-dimensional echocardiographic study within 48 hours (mean 20 hours) of entry into the study. This study semiquantitatively analyzed systolic performance of the ischemia-related segments by calculation of a total wall motion score. In 16 patients this investigation was combined with a continuous detailed recording of only the apical interventricular septal wall motion. This detailed study included measurements for regional function by providing a typification of the pattern of systolic and early diastolic excursion of the endocardial border of the apical interventricular septum. A repeat ultrasonic study was performed at least 1 month (median 2 months. 7 days) after admission. Results of the systolic wall motion analyses of all 35 patients showed. in both treatment groups. a significant improvement in systolic wall motion of the anterior and apical segments (mean total wall motion score at early study vs late study: revascularization. 6.9 vs 2.2 and medical therapy. 4.6 vs 1.0).',\n",
       " '14, Acute reduction of mitral valve area after percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty: assessment with Doppler continuity equation method, Mitral valve areas before and after balloon mitral valvuloplasty were serially determined by the Doppler continuity equation method in 16 patients. Ultrasound examinations were performed before and immediately after balloon inflation and 24 hours. 1 week. and 1 month after valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area determined by the Doppler continuity equation method correlated well with that determined at catheterization by the Gorlin formula. not only before but also immediately after balloon inflation (y = 0.87 x + 0.05. standard error of estimate = 0.22 cm2. r = 0.90). Serial calculation of mitral valve area by the Doppler continuity equation method showed a slight but significant decrease in the valve area at 24 hours after balloon mitral valvuloplasty but no change after that. We conclude that the Doppler continuity equation method provides an accurate estimation of mitral valve area before and even after balloon valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area dilated by balloon inflation is decreased slightly within 24 hours after the procedure. which corroborates valve stretch as one mechanism for increasing mitral valve area with balloon valvuloplasty. Estimation of mitral valve area immediately after balloon mitral valvuloplasty may overestimate the long-term efficacy of the procedure.',\n",

Diperdipine markedly reduced systemic vascular resistance and improved stroke index and left ventricular ejection fraction. Mean pulmonary artery and wedge pressures were slightly increased as a possible consequence of enhanced venous return. whereas right atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures were not significantly changed. Nevertheless. an increase in preload was clearly indicated by an augmented left ventricular end-diastolic volume index after administration of diperdipine. Left ventricular contractility. which was estimated by the end-systolic pressure-volume ratio and by dP/dt max was not significantly changed. though analysis of individual data suggests a minimally negative inotropic effect. However. such a minor effect on left ventricular contractility was largely counterbalanced by the marked reduction of afterload. which produced a sharp improvement of stroke index. Enhancement of left ventricular ejection fraction and reduction in systemic vascular resistance were inversely and directly correlated to control values. Overall. diperdipine was well tolerated. but one patient had a major untoward reaction that consisted of an ischemic episode that was possibly related to drug administration. In conclusion. intravenous diperdipine appears to be a potent arteriolar dilating agent that does not affect left ventricular contractility.',\n",
       " '23, Time course of improvement in ventricular function after ablation of incessant automatic atrial tachycardia, A patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and supraventricular tachycardia presumed to be of sinus origin was referred for cardiac transplantation. The extreme rate of the tachycardia during exercise. profound fluctuations in heart rate. and the presence of an abnormal P wave axis suggested the diagnosis of incessant ectopic atrial tachycardia rather than compensatory sinus tachycardia. Electrophysiologic study with endocardial activation sequence mapping confirmed the diagnosis of an ectopic left atrial automatic tachycardia. after which surgical cryoablation of the left atrial focus was carried out successfully and sinus rhythm was restored. Serial radionuclide angiocardiograms obtained before and after surgery demonstrated a very rapid recovery of left ventricular function to nearly normal within the first month after surgery. followed by further improvement to normal over the next several months. The diagnosis of tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy should be seriously considered in any patient with apparently end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and persistent resting tachycardia.',\n",
       " '14, Identification of the rate-dependent functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node in simulated atrial fibrillation, We continuously observed successive pairs of R-R intervals during atrial fibrillation and hypothesized that the shortest R-R interval for a given preceding R-R interval in a pair represents the functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node at that preceding interval. To test this hypothesis we simulated atrial fibrillation in 28 isolated cross-perfused canine hearts and obtained an R-R interval scatterplot by plotting the R-R intervals as a function of the immediately preceding R-R interval. This scatterplot enabled us to detect a series of the shortest R-R intervals for a wide range of preceding R-R intervals. and this allowed us to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node in simulated atrial fibrillation. The estimated functional refractory periods correlated well with those measured by the conventional method (r = 0.93). We conclude that the proposed method makes it possible to estimate the rate-dependent functional refractory periods of the atrioventricular node in atrial fibrillation.',\n",

All had at least a 90% reduction in the diameter of the major coronary artery. Collateral vessels were seen in 32 of 33 (97%) patients with total occlusion. All patients with severe stenosis but not total occlusion had no or poorly developed collateral vessels. Analysis according to the presence or absence of collateral vessels showed no significant differences in the results of treadmill stress testing and myocardial imaging between these two groups. In patients treated surgically. the abnormalities recognized by these tests were normalized or improved when the bypass was patent. These data indicate that collateral circulation in patients with Kawasaki disease cannot be seen angiographically unless there is total occlusion and the presence of collateral circulation cannot provide protection against stress-induced myocardial ischemia.',\n",

The kinase is ubiquitously expressed and can promote proliferation. presumably in a manner dependent on growth-factor receptors and membrane-associated oncogenes. We have now examined the dependence of serum- and TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-regulated NIH/3T3 cell growth on RAF-1 kinase to determine whether Raf-1 is essential for receptor signalling. We inhibited Raf-1 function by expressing c-raf-1 antisense RNA or kinase-defective c-raf-1 mutants. Antisense RNA for c-raf-1 interferes with proliferation of normal NIH/3T3 cells and reverts raf-transformed cells. In revertant cells. DNA replication induced by serum or TPA was eliminated or reduced proportionately to the reduction in Raf protein levels. Expression of a kinase-defective Raf-1 mutant (craf301) or a regulatory domain fragment (HCR) inhibited serum-induced NIH/3T3-cell proliferation and raf transformation even more efficiently. Inhibition by antisense RNA or craf301 blocked proliferation and transformation by Ki- and Ha-ras oncogenes. We conclude that raf functions as an essential signal transducer downstream of serum growth factor receptors. protein kinase C and ras.',\n",

The Physicians' Health Study. a randomized double-masked placebo-controlled trial among 22.071 male physicians. aged 40 to 84 years. provided the opportunity to collect information about whether low-dose aspirin therapy (325 mg on alternate days) affects the development or extraction of cataract. There were 173 age-related cataracts among those physicians assigned to aspirin therapy and 180 among those given placebo (relative risk. 0.95; 95% confidence interval. 0.74 to 1.22). Cataract extractions were less frequent in the aspirin than in the placebo group. but this difference was not statistically significant (relative risk. 0.80; 95% confidence interval. 0.56 to 1.15). Among younger men (aged 40 to 59 years). the relative risks were 0.62 (95% confidence interval. 0.40 to 0.94) for cataract development and 0.67 (95% confidence interval. 0.38 to 1.31) for cataract extraction. These randomized trial data tend to exclude any large benefit of aspirin.

       " '14, Septal ventricular pacing in the immature canine heart: a new perspective, Cardiac pacing initiated from epicardial or transvenous apical right ventricular electrodes causes asynchronous ventricular contraction. This alters myocardial stress vectors and results in adverse cellular and subcellular changes in the experimental animal. Clinically. such changes may contribute to the adverse hemodynamics reported with long-term ventricular pacing. To determine the feasibility of direct stimulation of the ventricular specialized conduction systems and therefore the potential for maintenance of normalized depolarization patterns. 13 beagle puppies were studied. Baseline ventricular activation and contraction patterns were obtained using intracardiac electrograms and multigated nuclear acquisition (MUGA) imaging. Septal electrode insertion from the aortoatrial groove was accomplished by use of two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring of the surface ECG during pacemaker implantation in five puppies. Standard right ventricular epicardial electrodes were implanted in five additional animals. with three remaining as age-matched non-paced controls. After 4 months of observation. repeat MUGA imaging and intracardiac electrograms demonstrated nearly normal biventricular activation and contraction patterns among the septal-paced group. Histopathologic examination illustrated normal cellular morphology in the septal-paced animals. This study demonstrates that pacing electrode insertion into the proximal interventricular septum is feasible and results in utilization of the normal ventricular conduction pathway. Such an approach to initiation of ventricular stimulation may attenuate the adverse effects of long-term ventricular pacing.',\n",

However. other calcium channel blocking drugs have been shown to reduce shock success for defibrillation. a deleterious effect. Thus the purposes of this study were to assess the effect of nisoldipine on the hemodynamic responses to the sequences of ventricular fibrillation-defibrillation. and its effect on the energy requirements for defibrillation. In 16 dogs we administered intravenous nisoldipine (1 microgram/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.075 to 0.50 microgram/kg/min) to lower mean blood pressure 10% and 20% below baseline. Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically. and shocks of varying energy levels (30. 50. and 100 joules) were administered to determine defibrillation energy requirements. Heart rates and blood pressures were recorded up to 3 minutes after each shock to determine hemodynamic responses. Measurements were made before nisoldipine administration and again at the two levels of drug-induced blood pressure decline. We found that the usual systolic blood pressure \"overshoot\" after defibrillation (typically maximum at 15 to 30 seconds after shocks) was significantly blunted after nisoldipine administration (p less than 0.05). Heart rate slowing after defibrillation (a cholinergic response) was not affected. Nisoldipine did not alter shock success rates. which varied from 12 +/- 7%SE at 30 joules to 68 +/- 12% at 100 joules. Thus nisoldipine blunted the \"adrenergic overshoot\" of systolic blood pressure following defibrillation. a potentially beneficial effect. without altering the energy requirements for transthoracic defibrillation.',\n",

Extension-flexion motion, Frequently instability and premature onset of spondylosis of the cervical spine are found in athetoid cerebral palsy (CP) patients. These structural abnormalities appear to be related to athetoid motion of the neck in CP. Through motion analysis. the authors aimed to clarify the abnormalities of cervical motion that could precipitate structural abnormalities. The gross characteristic feature of cervical motion in athetoid CP is \"whip movement.\" Both velocity and acceleration during extension-flexion motion were greater than in normal subjects. especially at the upper cervical levels. Also. a sudden increase in velocity and acceleration occurred during rapid motions at certain levels. followed by a larger range of motion of the cervical spine. Such kinematic abnormalities were thought to generate a greater shearing force and bending moment exerted on the corresponding cervical articulations-discs and facets. Olisthetic instability often accompanied disc degeneration at the upper cervical levels. A large range of extension--flexion motion of the cervical spine. analogous to a cantilever. caused a repeated bending moment of extraordinary magnitude and was regarded as a precipitative factor for disc degeneration and osteophytosis common at the middle and lower levels of the disc.',\n",

When these live recombinant bacteria were administered i.p. to BALB/c mice they induced high titer anti-hepatitis B virus core Ag (HBc) and detectable anti-pre-S2 serum antibodies. Upon oral feeding of the recombinant salmonellae to mice. the rate of seroconversion to anti-HBc was dependent on the salmonella strain used. With the best carrier strain high titer anti-HBc antibodies and lower titer anti-pre-S2 serum IgG antibodies were observed two weeks after a single oral immunization. The Ig class and IgG subclass distribution of anti-HBc antibodies after i.p. and oral immunization is consistent with the induction of functional T cell help.',\n",

The majority of residents of the village of Bonahoi. in an area where transmission of filariasis had been interrupted by a 20-year insecticide spray program to control malaria. showed no parasitologic signs of active W. bancrofti infection and were negative for both circulating phosphorylcholine Ag and peripheral blood microfilariae. In contrast. adult residents of the village of Nanaha were in an area exposed to infection. and were phosphorylcholine-Ag- and microfilariae-positive. The antibody response of these two groups to both adult worm excretory/secretory (ES) Ag and somatic antigen extract was examined to determine which components of the filarial-specific immune response were dependent on active infection. Identification of these immune responses may point to immunologic methods to evaluate control programs for lymphatic filariasis. Adults from Bonahoi were found to have significant immune responses to [35S] methionine-labeled ES Ag by immunoprecipitation and to adult somatic antigen extracts by ELISA and by immunoblotting. This result is consistent with the fact that these individuals were previously exposed to and/or infected with W. bancrofti. Similarly. residents of the endemic village had detectable immune responses to these Ag irrespective of if they were microfilaremic. The most striking immunologic difference observed between the two groups was that residents of Bonahoi had a dramatically reduced filarial-specific IgG4 antibody response to both adult somatic Ag and adult ES Ag. These data suggest that longitudinal measurement of filarial-specific IgG4 levels may be a useful seroepidemiologic indicator of changes in W. bancrofti infection status.',\n",

Prior results suggested that the mechanism of resistance was mediated at a step after C3 deposition. Equivalent amounts of C3b were deposited on serum-susceptible. noninfective promastigotes harvested from log stage cultures (LOG) and on C-resistant. infective. metacyclic promastigotes (MP) purified from stationary stage cultures. Whereas binding of C9 to LOG was stable during incubation in serum. C9 binding to MP was minimal and unstable. because molecules bound initially to MP were released with continued incubation. Failure to bind C9 was not a result of inability to activate C; the kinetics of C3. C6. and C9 consumption were similar for LOG and MP. Deposition of C5b-7 on MP was stable. indicating that the initial steps in terminal complex formation were intact. Instead. the majority of C5b-9 formed on MP was spontaneously released into the serum as SC5b-9. Residual C5b-9 on MP was released with 1 M NaCl. These data show that developmental modification of the promastigote membrane during transition from a noninfective to an infective stage blocks insertion of lytic C5b-9 into the promastigote membrane.',\n",

C57BL/6. and BALB/c mice was reduced by a single dose of histamine given 24 h before tumor cell inoculation. The antimetastatic effect of histamine was specifically mediated by histamine H2-receptors (H2R): it was blocked by the H2R antagonist ranitidine and mimicked by dimaprit. a specific H2R agonist but not by an H2R-inactive structural analog of this compound. nor-dimaprit. or the H1R agonist 2-thiazolyl-ethylamide. A single dose of any of the H2R antagonists ranitidine. tiotidine. famotidine. or cimetidine drastically augmented metastasis. Effects of H2R-interactive compounds on B16 metastasis required intact NK cells. as judged by the inability of histamine or ranitidine to affect B16 metastasis after NK cell depletion in vivo using antibodies to asialo-GM1. NK-cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 lymphoma cells in vivo was enhanced by histamine and reduced by ranitidine within 4 h after inoculation of tumor cells. The antimetastatic effect of IL-2 was potentiated by histamine; in some experiments. combined treatment with a low dose of IL-2 (6000 U/kg) and histamine completely eliminated metastasis. whereas concomitant treatment with ranitidine abrogated antimetastatic effects of IL-2; animals treated with ranitidine and IL-2 displayed the same level of enhanced metastasis as those treated with ranitidine alone. The presented data are suggestive of an earlier unrecognized role for histamine in NK cell-mediated resistance against metastatic tumor cells.',\n",
       " '6, Isolation and characterization of cDNA encoding a human nuclear antigen predominantly recognized by autoantibodies from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, Autoantibodies to a novel nuclear Ag. Sp100. have recently been described that recognize a nuclear protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 to 100 kDa and a dot-like distribution within cell nuclei. By immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from HeLa cells with an anti-Sp100 autoimmune serum a 0.7-kb cDNA (Sp26) coding for a fragment of Sp100 was isolated. Expression of this cDNA and use of the recombinant protein in ELISA revealed that the fragment carries major Sp100 autoepitopes and that anti-Sp100 autoantibodies predominantly occur in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis (50/184). The Sp26 cDNA was used as hybridization probe for isolation of longer cDNA from human liver- and placenta-derived lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. Overlapping fragments were assembled to generate a full length cDNA coding for a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.7. The Sp100 autoantigen expressed in vitro from this cDNA and authenticated by a capture immunoblot assay. comigrated in SDS-PAGE with the authentic HeLa autoantigen of 95 to 100 kDa and thus showed an aberrant electrophoretic mobility. Computer based protein sequence analysis of the Sp100 autoantigen revealed regions of striking sequence similarities to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of various human and non-human MHC class I Ag and to several transacting transcriptional regulatory proteins.',\n",
       " '10, Increased arterial adrenaline is related to pain in uncomplicated myocardial infarction, Plasma levels of catecholamines. beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). and degree of pain were examined in 22 patients with suspected uncomplicated myocardial infarction within 24 h following onset of chest pain. Sixteen patients developed infarction with peak creatine phosphokinase at 1280 Ul-1 (range 293-3770 Ul-1). Fifteen healthy men served as controls (C). Arterial adrenaline levels were significantly higher in patients with pain (1.15 +/- 0.23 nmol l-1. n = 8. mean value +/- SEM) than in those without pain (0.60 +/- 0.10 nmol l-1. n = 14. P less than 0.05). Plasma catecholamines were moderately but significantly elevated in myocardial infarction; the concentration of arterial adrenaline was 0.83 +/- 0.14 nmol l-1 and that of arterial noradrenaline was 2.70 +/- 0.28 nmol l-1 compared with 0.44 +/- 0.04 nmol l-1 (P less than 0.025) and 1.47 +/- 0.05 nmol l-1 (P less than 0.0005). respectively. in C. One week later. plasma catecholamines had returned to baseline levels. Plasma BTG showed borderline elevation (1.0 +/- 0.1 pmol l-1) compared with C (0.6 +/- 0.1 pmol l-1. P = 0.04). and remained unchanged 1 week later. Plasma AVP was at baseline level. Uncomplicated myocardial infarction. regardless of size. was associated with only moderately increased sympathetic tone. Plasma adrenaline was related more to the degree of pain than to the presence of acute myocardial infarction. Arterial adrenaline may be a sensitive marker of sympatho-adrenal activity related to pain.',\n",
       " '14, Increased whole blood viscosity combined with decreased erythrocyte fluidity in untreated patients with essential hypertension, Erythrocyte fluidity and other haemorheological variables were studied in 22 patients with essential hypertension and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Hypertensive patients displayed a significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity (P less than 0.001). Similarly. significantly elevated values for haematocrit. plasma and whole blood viscosity. as well as aggregation tendency were observed compared to controls. Although differing in these respects from controls. there were no obvious relationships between these rheological variables and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity and other changes in haemorheological variables of red blood cells found in hypertensive patients may be explained by an enlarged metabolic pool of free calcium ions in these red blood cells. It is suggested that the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of essential hypertension are multifactorial rather than being based on a single molecular derangement. Primary events resulting in altered physicochemical properties of the red blood cells may work in concert in the development of essential hypertension. in addition to the increased availability of calcium ions and their potential role in smooth muscle contraction.',\n",

Within weeks. the new onset of pulmonary infiltrates and renal failure prompted biopsy of the patient's kidney. A necrotizing glomerulonephritis. compatible with a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. was present. Vasculitis of the temporal artery may be a feature of Wegener's granulomatosis.\",\n",
       " '10, Temporal arteritis with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates presenting as occipital neuralgia, A retrospective review of 46 patients with biopsy-proven giant cell (temporal) arteritis revealed 8 (17%) whose initial presentation was occipital pain. The most likely etiology of occipital pain in these patients was occipital artery inflammation. A Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate less than 40 mm/hour was noted at presentation in 6 of these 8 patients. Giant cell arteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of elderly patients who present with occipital pain and demonstrate a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate.',\n",

This otherwise healthy young woman first presented with generalized venulopathy. with chemosis. facial swelling. pleural effusions. and pericardial tamponade. The symptoms partially responded to steroid therapy. but over a 2-year course. a rapidly progressive and fatal venoocclusive disease developed. No other primary condition was diagnosed. and at autopsy. the patient had striking venulitis throughout. including the pulmonary bed. We believe that this is a unique case of pulmonary hypertension resulting from a generalized venulopathy.',\n",
       " \"20, Association of the complement allele C4AQ0 with primary Sjogren's syndrome in Japanese patients, We studied allotypes of the fourth component of complement (C4) and factor B in 76 patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and in 63 normal subjects. C4A-null (C4AQ0) was found in 10 of 28 patients who had primary SS. compared with 1 of 63 control subjects (P less than 0.005). In contrast. no significant difference in the frequency of any C4 allotype was observed between patients with secondary SS and control subjects. An association of HLA-DRw53 with primary SS in Japanese patients has been reported. Since there is no linkage disequilibrium between DRw53 and C4AQ0. it is possible that at least 2 genes in the major histocompatibility complex may determine susceptibility to the development of primary SS in the Japanese population.\",\n",
       " '8, The role of passive immunity in bovine respiratory syncytial virus-infected calves, The role of passive immunity in bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections in neonatal calves was evaluated. Calves were divided into groups as follows: colostrum-deprived. sham-inoculated; colostrum-deprived. BRSV-inoculated; and colostrum-fed. BRSV-inoculated. Calves were inoculated with a low-passage field isolate of BRSV for 4 consecutive days by a combined respiratory tract route and were euthanized 6 days after receiving the last inoculation. Arterial oxygen tension (Pao2) decreased significantly over time in colostrum-deprived. BRSV-inoculated calves (P less than .01) and was significantly different among treatment groups (P less than .05). A significant decrease in arterial oxygen saturation was observed in this same group over time (P less than .01). Mean percentage of pneumonic lung volume (determined by computer data digitalization) was significantly greater in infected. colostrum-deprived calves compared with the other groups (P less than .01). and BRSV antigen was detected in these calves by avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase staining. Thus. passive immunity derived from colostrum feeding decreased the severity of BRSV infections in calves.',\n",
       " '2, Pattern of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics in Finland: two-year cycles with alternating prevalence of groups A and B, Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay with monoclonal antibodies distinguishing between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) group A and B strains was used to analyze their prevalence in Finland during 1981-1990 among 3285 patients with laboratory diagnosis of RSV. most of them hospitalized. The group typing of antigens in 608 RSV-positive nasopharyngeal aspirates showed a regular alternation of group prevalence. following the cyclic occurrence of the virus. Group A predominated in 73%-90% of specimens from 1981-1982. 1985-1986. and 1989-1990. whereas group B predominated in 70%-100% of specimens from 1983-1984 and 1987-1988. The epidemiologic occurrence of verified reinfections in hospitalized children and the group typing results indicated that children greater than 6 months of age during the first infection were more resistant to severe reinfection with the homologous than with the heterologous group of virus. The study shows that group antigenic variation of RSV has a significant effect on the epidemiology of the virus.',\n",

Participants were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae. and Trichomonas vaginalis. and serum antibody to CMV was determined. Demographic and sexual history data were collected by interview. The mean number of lifetime sex partners was 2.2; 173 (68%) were seropositive. Race. greater than 3 years of sexual activity. and greater than 2 lifetime sex partners were significant risk factors for CMV infection (odds ratios [OR]. 1.8-4.7; P less than .05). Using logistic regression analysis. a composite sexual activity variable was the most important risk factor for CMV infection (OR. 4.8; P = .003). followed by race (OR. 3.4; P = .004) and a sexually transmitted disease composite variable (OR. 2.4; P = .016). Sexual activity is an important risk factor for CMV infection in adolescent girls.',\n",

HIV antibody was sought in homosexual men who developed HBV infection during a hepatitis B vaccine trial. Among 134 unvaccinated HIV-1-negative men. 7% became HBV carriers. 64% had viremia. and 42% had clinical illness. Among vaccinated HIV-1-negative men. HBV infection severity decreased with number of vaccine doses administered. When adjusted for prior hepatitis B vaccination status. persons with HIV-1 infection preceding HBV infection had a significantly higher risk of developing HBV carriage. viremia. prolonged ALT elevation. and clinical illness. Among HIV-1-infected men. the risk of HBV carriage was increased in unvaccinated persons (21%) and those who failed to respond to vaccination (31%) and further increased in those who received vaccine doses at the time they developed new HBV infection (56%-80%). suggesting inactivated hepatitis B vaccine may temporarily impair the immune response to HBV infection in HIV-1-infected persons. HIV-1 infection was also associated with reduced alanine aminotransferase elevations during the first 36 months of follow-up of men who became HBV carriers.',\n",
       " '18, The relationship between symptomatic and biochemical hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, The relationship between symptomatic (subjective feelings) and biochemical (blood glucose concentration less than 3 mmol l-1) hypoglycaemia was studied in 66 randomly selected insulin-dependent diabetic out-patients under normal conditions of daily life with conventional insulin injection regimens. The patients (a) collected 7-point diurnal blood glucose profiles at home on three consecutive days and then once weekly for 3 weeks. (b) indicated whether they felt hypoglycaemic at sampling times. and (c) collected extra samples if they felt hypoglycaemic at any time during the study period. The weekly frequencies of symptomatic and biochemical hypoglycaemia were 0.99 and 1.75 per patient. respectively. Biochemical hypoglycaemia was present in 29% of the symptomatic episodes. and symptomatic hypoglycaemia accompanied 16% of the biochemical episodes. Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was experienced at a median blood glucose concentration of 3.4 mmol l-1 (range 1.4-14.9 mmol l-1). Fifty per cent of both symptomatic and biochemical episodes occurred before lunch. while the remainder were evenly distributed throughout the day. The occurrence of biochemical hypoglycaemia. but not of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. was inversely correlated with HbA1c and median blood glucose concentration. Thus symptomatic hypoglycaemia is an unreliable indicator of biochemical hypoglycaemia and of the degree of glycaemic control. Blood glucose measurements are a prerequisite for the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia.',\n",

Infants aged 2-5 months were randomized to receive one dose of either 10(4) pfu of the rhesus rotavirus vaccine or 10(8) pfu of the RIT 4237 vaccine or placebo. Eleven (10.2%) of 108 infants in the rhesus vaccine group. 11 (10.4%) of 106 in the RIT 4237 group. and 9 (8.4%) of 107 in the placebo group experienced rotavirus diarrhea during the follow-up period of 17 months.

Histologic and virologic examination of vaccinated rat lungs was done after challenge with RSV. When rats were challenged 1 month after vaccination. severe pulmonary inflammation characterized by both a mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate and 30%-40% involvement of lung tissue was observed with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine. The FG glycoprotein induced minimal lung inflammation (involving 2%-5% of the lung). while negative controls had 1%-3% lung involvement. Two doses with as little as 20 ng of FG glycoprotein formulated in an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant completely protected the cotton rats from RSV challenge. Thus the chimeric FG glycoprotein is highly immunogenic and induces minimal pulmonary inflammation in the cotton rat model.',\n",

       " '15, Long-term follow-up after heterotopic splenic autotransplantation for traumatic splenic rupture, The trapping function of the heterotopic splenic autotransplants (HSA) in 13 polytraumatized patients. aged 5-38 yr. was evaluated using heat damaged technetium-99m-labeled autologous red blood cells in early (1-7 mo) and late (3-4.5 yr) period after heterotopic autotransplantation to the omentum. The intensity of tracer accumulation was graded in comparison to the liver uptake. The splenic tissue surface was calculated on anterior projection each time. The shapes of the transplants were compared and new uptake foci suggesting spontaneous splenosis were looked for on both scans. The average surface of HSA was 28.2 (+/- 14.7) cm2 on early and 44.1 (+/- 14.3) cm2 on late examination (p less than 0.003) and the increase in intensity of tracer accumulation on both occasions was significant as well (p less than 0.0001). In three patients. some additional splenotic foci were found on follow-up scans. Howell-Jolly bodies in peripheral blood were detected in six of eight patients in early and remained detectable in lower number in three of eight patients on follow-up. No serious infection was noticed in our group of patients. Our work confirmed the excellent survival rates of HSA with improving trapping function and no important spread from original implantation site on long-term follow-up.',\n",

DESIGN--Randomised. double blind. placebo controlled crossover study. SETTING--Hospital outpatient clinics in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS--Twenty clinically stable patients (13 women. seven men) with nocturnal asthma. median age 39 (range 18-60) years. INTERVENTIONS--Salmeterol 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms and placebo taken each morning and evening by metered dose inhaler. Rescue salbutamol inhalers were provided throughout the run in and study periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Improvement in nocturnal asthma as measured by peak expiratory flow rates and change in sleep quality as measured by electroencephalography. RESULTS--Salmeterol improved the lowest overnight peak flow rate at both 50 micrograms (difference in median values (95% confidence interval for difference in medians) 69 (18 to 88) l/min) and 100 micrograms (72 (23 to 61) l/min) doses twice daily. While taking salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily patients had an objective improvement in sleep quality. spending less time awake or in light sleep (-9 (-4 to -44) min) and more time in stage 4 sleep (26 (6-34) min). CONCLUSIONS--Salmeterol is an effective long acting inhaled bronchodilator for patients with nocturnal asthma and at a dose of 50 micrograms twice daily improves objective sleep quality.',\n",
       " '20, Evaluation of peak flow and symptoms only self management plans for control of asthma in general practice, OBJECTIVE--To compare a peak flow self management plan for asthma with a symptoms only plan. DESIGN--Randomisation to one of the self management plans and follow up for a year. SETTING--Four partner. rural training practice in Norfolk. SUBJECTS--115 Patients (46 children and 69 adults) with asthma who were having prophylactic treatment for asthma and attending a nurse run asthma clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The number of doctor consultations. courses of oral steroids. and short term nebulised salbutamol treatments and the number of patients who required doctor consultations. courses of oral steroids. and short term nebulised salbutamol. RESULTS--Both self management plans produced significant reductions in the outcome measures but there were no significant differences in the degree of improvement between the groups. The results were similar for children and adults. The proportions of patients requiring a doctor consultation fell from 98% (50/51) to 66% (34/51) in the peak flow group and from 97% (62/64) to 53% (34/64) in the symptoms only group and the proportions requiring oral steroids from 73% (34/46) to 47% (21/46) and 52% (31/60) to 12% (7/60). The median number of doctor consultations was reduced from 8.0 to 2.0 in the peak flow group and from 4.5 to 1.0 in the symptoms only group. CONCLUSIONS--The peak flow meter was not the crucial ingredient in the improved illness of the two groups. Teaching patients the importance of their symptoms and the appropriate action to take when their asthma deteriorates is the key to effective management of asthma. Simply prescribing peak flow meters without a system of self management and regular review will be unlikely to improve patient care.',\n",

DESIGN--Pilot study of women eligible for screening but not for personal invitation. The results of this study were compared with the results of routinely screened younger women (aged 50-64) from the same general practice. SETTING--One group general practice in south Manchester. PATIENTS--The 631 women aged 65-79 on the practice list. A total of 42 (7%) were excluded by the general practitioner. and 22 (4%) invitation letters were returned by the post office. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response rates to invitation for screening assessed by three indices: crude population coverage ratio. crude invited population coverage ratio. and corrected invited population coverage ratio. RESULTS--344 Patients aged 65-79 (61% of those invited. excluding those who could not be traced) were screened compared with 77% of women aged 50-64. The three response indices were higher for younger women than older: crude population coverage ratio = 66.5%. crude invited population coverage ratio = 69.3%. corrected invited population coverage ratio = 76.8% for women aged 50-64. compared with 54.5%. 58.4%. and 60.7% respectively for women aged 65-79. All four biopsies done in the older women gave positive results. giving a cancer detection rate of 11.6/1000 compared with 4.1/1000 among younger women. CONCLUSIONS--These results show that there is a potential for high attendance at routine screening by older women if they are invited in the same way as younger women. If these results are found elsewhere the costs and benefits of screening older women should be reassessed.',\n",

DESIGN--Observational cohort study in HIV seropositive subjects with a current or past history of misusing injected drugs. SETTING--HIV outpatient clinic at the University Hospital of Zurich. Switzerland. PATIENTS--297 Current and former parenteral drug misusers (median age 27) with asymptomatic HIV infection. During the observation period 80 subjects adhered to a programme of maintenance treatment with methadone. 124 continued with parenteral drug misuse. and 93 former misusers remained free of illicit drugs. No antiretroviral treatment was given during the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Probability of progression of HIV infection from asymptomatic to symptomatic (Centers for Disease Control stage IV) as calculated by life table analysis and compared in the three groups of patients by means of a log rank test. and predictors of disease progression as analysed with a Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS--The 297 patients were followed up for a median of 16 months. The median duration of injecting drug misuse before enrollment was 7.1 years. There were no significant differences among the three groups with respect to CD4+ counts at the beginning of the study (median 0.44 x 10(9)/l). Life table analysis showed a significantly lower probability of progression of HIV disease in both the methadone treated group and former drug misusers than in persistent injecting drug misusers. Multivariate regression analysis showed a relative risk of progression of the disease of 1.78 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.67; p less than 0.01) in persistent injecting drug misusers. 0.48 (0.29 to 0.77; p less than 0.01) in the methadone treated group. and 0.66 (0.41 to 1.06; p = 0.085) in former drug misusers. CONCLUSIONS--Stopping the misuse of injected drugs slows the progression of HIV disease in infected subjects. Drug treatment programmes are effective in secondary prevention of HIV associated morbidity.',\n",
       " '21, Abuse of elderly people by their carers, OBJECTIVE--To assess the prevalence of abuse of elderly people by their carers and the characteristics of abusers and the abused. DESIGN--Information on abuse and risk factors was collected over six months from carers and patients. Risk factors were identified in the abused group and compared with those in a non-abused control group. SETTING--Carers were interviewed at home; patients were examined in the wards of Putney and Barnes geriatric hospitals. London. SUBJECTS--All patients referred from any source for respite care to the geriatric services over a six month period and their carers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Amount of physical and verbal abuse or neglect. Quantification of risk factors and correlation with the presence or absence of abuse. RESULTS--45% Of carers openly admitted to some form of abuse. Few patients admitted abuse. The most significant risk factor for physical abuse was alcohol consumption by the carer (p less than 0.001). Other significant risk factors were a poor pre-morbid relationship and previous abuse over many years. Abuse was often reciprocated and was associated with social dysfunction in many patients. Service delivery. respite care. and level of mental and physical disability were not significantly associated with abuse. CONCLUSION--The high level of abuse found in elderly patients in respite care was particularly associated with alcohol abuse and long term relationships of poor quality. which are difficult to change. Even with increased provision of services. care in the community may not be the best solution for these people.',\n",

DESIGN--Longitudinal. observational study with a mean follow up of five years. SETTING--Hawaii Osteoporosis Center. Honolulu. SUBJECTS--1017 Japanese-American men born between 1900 and 1920. of whom 378 were treated for hypertension (study group) and 639 did not have hypertension (control group). INTERVENTION--Thiazide diuretics were taken by 325 men for a mean of 11.9 years; 53 men took antihypertensive drugs other than thiazides. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rate of bone loss estimated from serial photon absorptiometric scanning at three skeletal sites (calcaneus. distal radius. and proximal radius). RESULTS--Rates of bone loss at all three sites were significantly reduced among thiazide users when compared with controls. The reductions in loss rate ranged from 28.8% (p = 0.02) (distal radius) to 49.2% (p = 0.0005) (calcaneus) relative to the controls. At all three sites the men taking other antihypertensive drugs had faster loss rates (22.6-43.1%) than those of the controls but the difference was significant only for the distal radius. CONCLUSION--Thiazide diuretics slow the rate of bone loss in elderly men.',\n",

DESIGN--Prospective multicentre trial in which patients were randomised to treatment or no treatment with antibiotics. Patients were seen at three and six weeks and three. six. nine. 12. and 18 months after their first visit. SETTING--Departments of infectious diseases in three hospitals in Linkoping. Malmo. and Stockholm. Sweden. PATIENTS--40 Consecutive patients who had had symptoms of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection for less than four weeks. INTERVENTIONS--20 Patients were allocated to treatment with antibiotics and 20 patients did not receive antibiotics. All patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. and four also received intra-articular steroid injections after at least six weeks' observation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Arthritic symptoms assessed clinically and by using Ritchies' index; blood measurements reflecting inflammatory activity; serum IgG. IgM. and IgA antibody titres; HLA tissue type. RESULTS--No difference was observed concerning duration of arthritis. grade of inflammation. and number of joints affected between patients treated and those not treated with antibiotics. Furthermore. there was no significant difference between the two groups in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and haptoglobin. IgG. and IgA concentrations. All values had returned to normal within three months. No patient developed chronic arthritis. but sustained slight arthralgia occurred in three patients. The HLA-B27 antigen was found in 23 (58%) of the patients. and its presence did not affect clinical outcome. The IgG. IgM. and IgA antibody responses were similar in patients treated with antibiotics and those not treated. CONCLUSION--Short term antibiotic treatment has no beneficial effect on the clinical outcome of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection.\",\n",

DESIGN--Double blind. placebo controlled. randomised study. SETTING--Intensive care unit at a major teaching hospital. PATIENTS--105 Unconscious adults admitted consecutively with suspected drug overdosage during 18 months from a total of 362 cases of poisoning. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy. epilepsy. obvious poisoning with drugs identified unequivocally from information from relatives or others as other than benzodiazepines. and coma score greater than 10 on a scale graded from 4 to 20. Patients were allocated randomly to receive flumazenil (21 men and 32 women) or placebo (25 men and 27 women). INTERVENTIONS--Intravenous injection of flumazenil (10 ml. 0.1 mg/ml) or placebo (10 ml vehicle alone) given double blind over three minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serum and urine concentrations of benzodiazepines. antidepressants. and several other agents; blood gas tensions; standardised evaluation on admission and five minutes after the injection by means of coma scale score and urgent diagnostic or therapeutic interventions indicated according to the history and clinical examination; standardised interview after the injection to try to ascertain further information; and adverse reactions. RESULTS--Benzodiazepines were found in the serum in 36 of the 53 patients in the flumazenil group and in 37 of the 52 who received placebo. The average coma scale score increased significantly after injection in the flumazenil group (6.4 v 12.1. p less than 0.001) but not in the placebo group. In the flumazenil group several interventions were rendered unnecessary by the injection: gastric lavage and urinary catheterisation (19 patients each). intubation (21). artificial ventilation and computed tomography of the brain (three patients each). blood culture and lumbar puncture (one patient each). and electroencephalography (two). In the placebo group the indications for these procedures did not change in any patient after injection. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in reduction of the frequency of indications for gastric lavage after injection between the two groups was 21% to 51%. that for intubation 25% to 55%. and that for urinary catheterisation 21% to 51%. In the flumazenil group 21 patients gave valuable information on their drug ingestion within 10 minutes after injection compared with only one in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Nine adverse reactions were recorded in the flumazenil group. eight of which were graded as mild and one severe. The safety of the antagonist was acceptable. even though 60% of the patients in the flumazenil group had multiple drug poisoning including benzodiazepine. No epileptic seizures or arrhythmias were recorded. CONCLUSION--Flumazenil is a valuable and safe differential diagnostic tool in unclear cases of multiple drug poisoning.',\n",

Many unusual complications of colonoscopy have been described. but only anecdotal reports of hernial incarceration have been published. We present a case of a right-sided hernial incarceration of the colonoscope that would not permit reduction of the hernia nor removal of the instrument by conventional means. The mechanism of incarceration. which dictates the size of hernia at risk for incarceration. is explained. The \"pulley\" technique. which was used to remove the instrument without surgical intervention. is described.',\n",

There have been four previous reported cases within the population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Because of the increasing incidence of HIV infection within regions where histoplasmosis is endemic. this condition may become more common. Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis has protean clinical manifestations. and symptoms are often nonspecific. Any patient with HIV infection who has unexplained GI symptoms should undergo evaluation for possible histoplasmosis. Aggressive long-term amphotericin B therapy has been effective in HIV patients with histoplasmosis. Resection or diversion of symptomatic colonic strictures caused by histoplasmosis may be necessary in addition to medical therapy.',\n",

A new method of treatment by anoplasty, Chronic anal fissure is a common condition usually treated by maximal anal dilatation or lateral subcutaneous sphincterotomy. The following method is based on a common surgical principal; to widen a stenosed tube a longitudinal incision is made across the stenosed area and this is sutured transversely as in pyloroplasty. This method of anoplasty is simple and appears to have no resultant complications. Further studies are necessary before its value can be established compared to the presently accepted methods of treatment.',\n",

       " '6, Impairment of esophageal emptying with hiatal hernia, Concurrent videofluoroscopy and manometry were used to analyze esophageal emptying during barium swallows in 22 patients with axial hiatal hernias and in 14 volunteers. Subjects were divided into three groups: (a) volunteers with maximal phrenic ampullary length less than 2 cm (controls); (b) patients or volunteers with maximal ampullary/hiatal hernia length greater than or equal to 2 cm that reduced between swallows (reducing-hernia group); and (c) patients with hernias that did not reduce between swallows. Complete esophageal emptying without retrograde flow was achieved in 86% of test swallows in the controls. 66% in the reducing-hernia group. and 32% in the nonreducing-hernia group (P less than 0.05). Impaired emptying in the reducing-hernia group was attributable to \"late retrograde flow.\" whereby barium squirted retrograde from the hernia during emptying. Impaired emptying in the nonreducing-hernia group was attributable to \"early retrograde flow\" that occurred immediately after LES relaxation. The nonreducing-hernia group also had longer acid clearance times than the controls (P less than 0.05). We conclude that gastroesophageal junction competence is severely impaired in patients with nonreducing hiatal hernias. suggesting a mechanism whereby this subgroup of hiatal hernia is involved in the pathogenesis of reflux disease.',\n",

In an outpatient setting. 61 women and 36 men with entry complaints of abdominal pain. altered bowel habits. or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified/eligible gastroenterologists who also systematically rated the presence or absence of the six Manning criteria. Irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for the entry complaints. This determination was made by two other board-certified gastroenterologists after patients had been in the study for 9 months. These raters were independent of the study and rated the transcripts of patients' clinic visits. all other available clinical data from this and other clinics. all laboratory data obtained during the 9-month study period. and the results of a 9-month telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the study population had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms. thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome for this study. A similar proportion and type of organic disease and irritable bowel syndrome were experienced by men and women. For the total sample of 97 subjects. the correlation of the Manning criteria with irritable bowel syndrome was 0.22 (P less than 0.01). In the 61 women. correlation between the Manning criteria and irritable bowel syndrome was significant (r = 0.47; P less than 0.01). In the 36 men. however. the correlation was in the opposite direction. although it was not significant (r = -0.16). It was concluded that significant gender differences exist when using the Manning criteria for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and that the Manning criteria were not of diagnostic value in men.\",\n",
       " '23, Role of leukotriene C4 in mucosal damage caused by necrotizing agents and indomethacin in the rat stomach, Intragastric ethanol stimulates mucosal formation of leukotriene C4 in the rat stomach. The present study demonstrates that the increase in leukotriene C4 formation begins within 30 seconds and is maximal within 5 minutes. closely paralleled by the appearance of hemorrhagic lesions. Leukotriene C4 formation returns to prechallenge levels within 3 hours. although erosions still persist. Intragastric 0.2N NaOH. acidified 100 mmol/L taurocholate. 25% NaCl. or 0.6N HCl did not consistently increase leukotriene C4 formation despite severe mucosal injury. A number of sulfhydryl-containing or sulfhydryl-blocking agents as well as metals protected against mucosal damage and simultaneously prevented the stimulation of leukotriene C4 formation induced by ethanol. None of the agents increased and some virtually abolished mucosal formation of prostaglandin E2. indicating that gastroprotection can occur completely independently of the endogenous prostaglandin system. The leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886 markedly suppressed gastric leukotriene C4 formation but did not protect against damage caused by ethanol. NaOH. NaCl. or acidified taurocholate. Oral indomethacin reduced the ex vivo formation of both prostaglandin E2 and. to a lesser extent. leukotriene C4 in the gastric mucosa. inducing a shift in the balance from protective prostaglandins to proulcerogenic leukotriene C4. Pretreatment with MK-886. however. did not significantly diminish indomethacin-induced lesions. These data suggest that leukotriene C4 is not the exclusive mediator of gastric injury caused by necrotizing agents or indomethacin. On the other hand. certain protective compounds exhibit a striking parallelism between protection and inhibition of ethanol-induced leukotriene C4 formation. suggesting that they may affect a target crucial for both mucosal injury and stimulation of 5-lipoxygenase.',\n",

There was an 88% (38/43) technical success rate (complete clot lysis) and a 74% (32/43) clinical success rate. Complications occurred in 10 patients (23%) and were related to bleeding in four patients (9%). Patient age. graft age. location. material. and the duration of occlusion did not significantly influence the initial outcome. although there was a trend toward a higher bleeding complication rate among grafts less than or equal to 1 month of age at the time of thrombolysis. A second group of 43 infrainguinal grafts successfully recanalized using regional infusions of thrombolytic agents were followed for long-term patency. This group included 32 grafts successfully treated with urokinase and 11 grafts recanalized with streptokinase. By life-table analysis there was a 55.6% 1-year patency. which fell to 42.4% at 4 years. Vein grafts had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than prosthetic grafts (69.3% versus 28.6% at 30 months). Grafts with flow-limiting lesions identified and corrected by angioplasty or surgery also had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than those without such lesions (79.0% versus 9.8% at 2 years). Based on the results of our study compared with a survey of long-term results following secondary surgical procedures for thrombosed infrainguinal grafts. thrombolysis can be recommended in several circumstances. Thrombolysis is indicated for thrombosed vein grafts or when thrombus is present in distal runoff vessels. Thrombosed prosthetic grafts should be replaced by autogenous vein grafts whenever possible.',\n",

Twenty-four patients were studied at around 7 days after musculoskeletal injuries in order to define the nature of the impairment of sensitivity to insulin. Insulin was infused at 6. 35. 200 or 1200 m-units min-1 m-2 for 2 h and the plasma glucose concentration was 'clamped' at 5 mmol/l. Forearm (uninjured) glucose extraction and blood flow were measured. and whole-body substrate oxidation and energy production rates were assessed by indirect calorimetry. The patients were compared with normal control subjects. 2. Plasma insulin concentrations during infusion were similar in patients and control subjects. showing a similar metabolic clearance of insulin. At each infusion rate. the rate of glucose infusion needed to maintain euglycaemia was less in the patients than in the control subjects. The dose-response curve for whole-body glucose infusion rate against plasma insulin concentration showed diminished sensitivity and diminished maximal response in the patients. A similar pattern was seen for forearm glucose uptake. with a marked impairment of both sensitivity to insulin and maximal responsiveness. 3. The resting metabolic rate was increased in the patients compared with the control subjects. but failed to respond to insulin infusion. so that final metabolic rates were similar in patients and control subjects. At the higher insulin infusion rates. the final rate of whole-body oxidation of carbohydrate was significantly less in the patients than in the control subjects. and that of fat was significantly greater.\",\n",

After the initial procedure. patients were followed with serial noninvasive studies and. in 71 patients. repeat angiography. The mean follow-up period was 7 years (range. 2-11 years). Standard life-table survival analysis was used to assess the factors potentially affecting long-term outcome.

After the first year. the prognosis (i.e.. failure rate) appears to be linear over the long term (i.e.. up to 10 years). Factors negatively influencing long-term patency include the presence of diabetes mellitus. diffuse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. or threatened limb loss. Technical factors correlated with failure include lesion length. moderate eccentricity. and a poor post-PTA appearance.',\n",

Although the system demonstrates that it can occasionally be useful for the management of occlusive as opposed to stenotic disease of the infrainguinal arteries. a close examination of the published data fails to demonstrate a consistent improvement in either the primary success or long-term patency rates for thermal energy applied to atheroma for recanalization of the lower extremity arteries.',\n",

       " '4, The growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells by a novel synthetic progestin involves the induction of transforming growth factor beta, Recent experimental work has identified a novel intracellular binding site for the synthetic progestin. Gestodene. that appears to be uniquely expressed in human breast cancer cells. Gestodene is shown here to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion. but has no effect on endocrine-responsive human endometrial cancer cells. Gestodene induced a 90-fold increase in the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) by T47D human breast cancer cells. Other synthetic progestins had no effect. indicating that this induction is mediated by the novel Gestodene binding site and not by the conventional progesterone receptor. Furthermore. in four breast cancer cell lines. the extent of induction of TGF-beta correlated with intracellular levels of Gestodene binding site. No induction of TGF-beta was observed with the endometrial cancer line. HECl-B. which lacks the Gestodene binding site. but which expresses high levels of progesterone receptor. The inhibition of growth of T47D cells by Gestodene is partly reversible by a polyclonal antiserum to TGF-beta. These data indicate that the growth-inhibitory action of Gestodene may be mediated in part by an autocrine induction of TGF-beta.',\n",
       " \"15, A deletion in the gene for glycoprotein IIb associated with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, The platelet fibrinogen receptor is composed of a complex of glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa on the surface of platelets. Deficient function of this receptor prevents normal platelet aggregation. resulting in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT). In this paper. we describe a black thrombasthenic patient who is either homozygous or hemizygous for a deletion within the GPIIb gene. Initial Western blot analysis of platelet proteins from this patient did not detect any GPIIb. but did detect small amounts of GPIIIa of normal mobility. Quantitation of vitronectin receptor (VNR) demonstrated that this thrombasthenic patient had approximately 1.5-2 times the number of these receptors per platelet compared with controls. a finding that has previously been noted in other thrombasthenic patients with defects in GPIIb. Genomic Southern blot studies demonstrated a deletion in the GPIIb gene of approximately 4.5 kilobasepairs (kb). Analysis of the isolated GPIIb gene demonstrated that the deletion begins between two Alu repeats within intron 1 and ends in intron 9. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies using platelet RNA and oligonucleotides directed to both the 5' and 3' ends of the GPIIb cDNA sequence easily detected GPIIb transcript. suggesting that the genomic deletion of exons 2-9 does not significantly decrease the level of the GPIIb mRNA. Sequence analysis of PCR-generated GPIIb cDNA showed that a cryptic AG splice acceptor sequence was being utilized. resulting in a transcript that contained a portion of introns 1 and 9. as well as having a deletion of exons 2-9. Unlike the GPIIb gene. the GPIIIa gene appears to be intact by Southern blot analysis. PCR studies using platelet RNA and oligonucleotides directed to the GPIIIa cDNA sequence demonstrated the presence of GPIIIa mRNA. In summary. the thrombasthenic state in this patient appears to be due to a GPIIb gene deletion resulting in an abnormal transcript and no detectable platelet GPIIb. Platelet GPIIIa levels were secondarily low presumably due to the known instability of GPIIIa in the absence of GPIIb.\",\n",

Effects of exogenous estrogen (Premarin) and dietary cholesterol on hepatic lipid metabolism, Our aim was to define mechanisms whereby conjugated estrogens (Premarin. exogenous estrogen; Ayerst Laboratories.

We studied gallbladder motor function. biliary lipid composition and secretion. cholesterol absorption. cholesterol synthesis and esterification by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the clearance of chylomicron remnants. and bile acid kinetics in 29 anovulatory women. 13 were studied on both a low (443 +/- 119 mumol/d) and high (2.021 +/- 262 mumol/d) cholesterol diet. Premarin increased the lithogenic index of bile (P less than 0.05). increased biliary cholesterol secretion (P less than 0.005). lowered chenodeoxycholate (CDCA) pool (P less than 0.001) and synthesis (P less than 0.05). altered biliary bile acid composition [( CA + DCA]/CDCA increases. P less than 0.005). stimulated cholesterol esterification (P less than 0.03). and enhanced the clearance of chylomicron remnants (P = 0.07). Increases in dietary cholesterol stimulated the biliary secretion of cholesterol (P = 0.07). bile acid (P less than 0.05). phospholipid (P = 0.07). and as a result. did not alter lithogenic index. The reduction in CDCA pool and synthesis by Premarin was reversed by increasing dietary cholesterol. Off Premarin. only 24% of the increase in cholesterol entering the body in the diet was recovered as biliary cholesterol or newly synthesized bile acid. On Premarin. 68% of this increase in cholesterol was recovered as these biliary lipids. We conclude that Premarin increases biliary cholesterol by enhancing hepatic lipoprotein uptake and inhibiting bile acid synthesis. These actions of Premarin divert dietary cholesterol into bile.',\n",

The present report documents the effect of thrombin treatment of platelets on this interaction in vitro and in vivo. In vitro. thrombin at 100-1.000 mU/ml maximally stimulated the adhesion of six different tumor cell lines from three different species two- to fivefold. As little as 1-10 mU/ml was effective. The effect of thrombin was specific (inhibitable by hirudin. dansyl-arginine N-(3-ethyl-1.5 pentanediyl) amide and unreactive with the inactive thrombin analogue N-P-tosyl-L-phenylchloromethylketone-thrombin and D-phenylalanyl-L-propyl-L-arginine chloromethylketone-thrombin (PPACK-thrombin). and required high-affinity thrombin receptors (competition with PPACK-thrombin but not with N-P-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl-ketone-thrombin). Functionally active thrombin was required on the platelet surface. Binding of tumor cells to thrombin-activated platelets was inhibitable by agents known to interfere with the platelet GPIIb-GPIIIa integrin: monoclonal antibody 10E5. tetrapeptide RGDS and gamma chain fibrinogen decapeptide LGGAKQAGDV. as well as polyclonal antibodies against the platelet adhesive ligands. fibronectin and vWF. In vivo. thrombin at 250-500 mU per animal increased murine pulmonary metastases fourfold with CT26 colon carcinoma cells and 68-413-fold with B16 amelanotic melanoma cells. Thus. thrombin amplifies tumor-platelet adhesion in vitro two- to fivefold via occupancy of high-affinity platelet thrombin receptors. and modulation of GPIIb-GPIIIa adhesion via an RGD-dependent mechanism. In vivo. thrombin enhances tumor metastases 4-413-fold with two different tumor cell lines.',\n",

       " '18, Obesity and the metabolic response to severe multiple trauma in man, In the obese state profound metabolic disturbances exist and it is not known how this disrupted metabolism in obese subjects (body mass index greater than 30) may change their ability to respond to the superimposed. injury-induced stress. Understanding the mechanisms that modify the metabolic parameters in traumatized obese patients is essential in their nutritional assessment and further treatment. We have investigated in 7 obese and 10 nonobese multiple trauma patients. on a whole-body level. the energy metabolism. protein kinetics. and lipolysis in the early catabolic \"flow phase\" of severe injury when they were receiving maintenance fluids without calories or nitrogen. Traumatized obese patients mobilized relatively more protein and less fat compared with nonobese subjects. A relative block both in lipolysis and fat oxidation is experienced by injured obese patients that results in a shift to preferential use of proteins and carbohydrates. Reduced endogenous protein synthetic efficiency observed in obese patients implies increased protein recycling. Thus obese patients could not effectively use their most abundant fat fuel sources and have to depend on other fuel sources. The nutritional management of obese trauma victims should therefore be tailored towards provision of enough glucose calories to spare protein.',\n",
       " '12, On the mechanism of impaired insulin secretion in chronic renal failure, It has been suggested that a sustained rise in resting levels of cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i of pancreatic islets is responsible for impaired insulin secretion in chronic renal failure (CRF). Evidence for such an event is lacking and the mechanisms through which it may affect insulin secretion are not known. Studies were conducted in normal. CRF. and normocalcemic. parathyroidectomized (PTX) CRF rats to answer these questions. Resting levels of [Ca2+]i of islets from CRF rats were higher (P less than 0.01) than in control of CRF-PTX rats. [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake and cAMP production by islets were not different in the three groups. Insulin content of. and glucose-induced insulin secretion by islets from CRF rats was lower (P less than 0.01) than in control and CRF-PTX rats. In contrast. glyceraldehyde-induced insulin release by CRF islets was normal. Basal ATP content. both glucose-stimulated ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio. net lactic acid output. Vmax of phosphofructokinase-1. and Ca2+ ATPase of islets from CRF rats were lower (P less than 0.02-less than 0.01) than in normal or CRF-PTX animals. Data show that: (a) Glucose but not glyceraldehyde-induced insulin secretion is impaired in CRF; (b) the impairment in glucose-induced insulin release in CRF is due to a defect in the metabolism of glucose; (c) this latter defect is due to reduced ATP content induced partly by high [Ca2+]i of islets; and (d) the high [Ca2+]i in islets of CRF rats is due to augmented PTH-induced calcium entry into cells and decreased calcium extrusion from the islets secondary to reduced activity of the Ca2+ ATPase.',\n",
       " '19, Newly identified pancreatic protein islet amyloid polypeptide. What is its relationship to diabetes, Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin is a newly identified 37-amino acid COOH-terminal-amidated polypeptide that is the major protein constituent of amyloid deposits in insulinomas and amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic humans and adult diabetic cats. IAPP is stored with insulin in beta-cell secretory vesicles and is cosecreted with insulin in response to glucose and several secretagogues. IAPP has been demonstrated in normal pancreatic islets of many species. but IAPP-derived amyloid develops commonly in the islets of only a few species (e.g.. humans and cats). especially in association with age-related diabetes. IAPP from the human and cat inherently contains a short amyloidogenic sequence that is not present in species that do not form islet amyloid. Studies in animals indicate that an aberration in the synthesis or processing of IAPP. leading to a local increase in concentration of IAPP in the islet. is also required to facilitate the conversion of IAPP to amyloid. The formation of islet amyloid may contribute to the development of type II diabetes by causing disruption of islet cells and by replacement of islets. It has also been proposed that an abnormality of IAPP homeostasis underlies the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. A significant causal relationship between IAPP and type II diabetes is based on reports that IAPP inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release by beta-cells and that IAPP inhibits insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells.',\n",

Time-course studies showed that hCG secretion peaked at 72-96 h with insulin exposure; in contrast. no decernable peak was seen without insulin in serum-free media. Exposure of JEG-3 cells for 24 h to 209 mg/liter insulin stimulated hCG synthesis. with 40 +/- 3% more immunoreactive intracellular hCG (P less than 0.05). Cells grown in the presence of insulin and [35S]methionine had 47 +/- 21% more labeled intracellular hCG and 56 +/- 13% more immunoprecipitable [35S]methionine-hCG secreted into the medium than the control cultures (P less than 0.05). During this time period. human placental lactogen release and total trichloroacetice acid-precipitable [35S]methionine protein were not increased. The insulin-induced stimulation of hCG synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Additionally. insulin did not significantly affect total intracellular protein during 24-96 h of incubation. Insulin also increased hCG release from JAR cells. but not from human term trophoblast cells. A mouse monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor inhibited the stimulation of insulin in JEG-3 cells. We conclude that insulin stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hCG from JEG-3 cells and JAR cells. and that hCG regulation in choriocarcinoma cells differs from that in primary human placental trophoblast cells. The effect of insulin on JEG-3 cells may be mediated in part through the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor.\",\n",
       " '5, Cyclosporin-A in vitro decreases bone resorption, osteoclast formation, and the fusion of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, We studied the in vitro effect of cyclosporin-A (CyA) on bone resorption using a fetal rat long bone-resorbing assay. CyA inhibited both PTH-stimulated and unstimulated bone resorption. The inhibitory effect of CyA on basal resorption was dose dependent. and it was more pronounced during the second period (less than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml) of culture (days 5-7) than during the first period (days 2-4). A cytotoxic effect was ruled out by the absence of decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation into bones up to a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml CyA. Histomorphometry performed after 4 and 7 days of culture showed that CyA (1 microgram/ml) decreased the number of osteoclasts per bone section after 7 days of culture (23.5 +/- 4.0 vs. 41.7 +/- 2.9 osteoclasts/bone section; P less than 0.05). but not after 4 days (25.6 +/- 3.3 vs. 23.0 +/- 2.5). These data suggested an effect of CyA on osteoclastic differentiation rather than on the function of mature osteoclasts. We further assessed the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of CyA on osteoclastic differentiation in order to determine 1) the level of this action (proliferation and/or fusion of osteoclast precursors). and 2) if this action is direct or indirect. Autoradiographic studies were performed on bone sections after incubation of bones with [3H]thymidine for the last 48 h of culture. CyA decreased slightly but significantly the percentage of labeled nuclei per osteoclast and the number of osteoclasts containing at least one labeled nucleus (20.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 33.2 +/- 3.5; P less than 0.02). Moreover the number of nuclei per osteoclast was decreased after 7 days in CyA-treated bones (2.4 +/- 0.05 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.1; P less than 0.02). Taken together these results demonstrate that CyA slightly decreased the proliferation of osteoclast precursors. but markedly decreased their fusion. Similar effects were observed in cultures of rat marrow macrophages. CyA (1 microgram/ml) inhibited the fusion of macrophages into multinucleated cells elicited by 1 nM 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. but had only a slight effect on the proliferation of these cells. as assessed by autoradiography. CyA also inhibited the formation of multinucleated cells and the fusion index in long term cultures of human cord blood monocytes. a cellular model for osteoclastic differentiation. By contrast. CyA had no effect on the formation of myotubes by fusion of cultured mononucleated rat myoblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).',\n",

All agents induced a rapid reduction of food intake and body weight after 1 day of treatment. Unlike TNF and LPS. IL-1 given as two daily administrations of 5 micrograms was lethal within 3 days. Mice treated with LPS or TNF rapidly developed tolerance to their anorectic effect. whereas tolerance to IL-1 required a longer time to develop and was not complete. We investigated the possible roles of changes in serum corticosterone and glucose in the effects of LPS. TNF and IL-1. A single injection of LPS. TNF. or IL-1 markedly increased serum corticosterone levels after 2 h. After only 2 days of chronic treatment. mice given LPS or TNF were refractory to induction of serum corticosterone by a subsequent injection of LPS or TNF. but mice given IL-1 for 2 days were still fully responsive to IL-1. IL-1. unlike TNF and LPS. induced a marked hypoglycemic response. Repeated administration of IL-1 sensitized to its hypoglycemic effect. This lack of adaptation to the increase of serum corticosterone and hypoglycemia was also observed when IL-1 was given at lower. nonlethal doses (0.25-1.0 microgram) and for a longer period (up to 8 days). The defective tolerance to the metabolic and toxic effects of IL-1 in this experimental model indicates that there are major differences between the in vivo biological responses to IL-1 and TNF.',\n",
       " '19, Is islet amyloid polypeptide a significant factor in pathogenesis or pathophysiology of diabetes, Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin. a recently discovered minor secretory peptide of the beta-cell related to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). is a constituent of amyloid deposits in the islets of many non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic individuals and some elderly nondiabetic subjects. IAPP is synthesized as a small precursor at a level of approximately 1% that of insulin and is processed. amidated. stored in beta-granules. and released along with insulin and C-peptide. Analysis of its gene (located on chromosome 12) supports an evolutionary relationship to calcitonin and CGRP. peptides with which it shares some biological actions. Like CGRP. IAPP antagonizes the action of insulin mainly at the level of muscle glycogen synthesis. but the levels required for this effect seem to be considerably higher than reported circulating levels. No evidence for overproduction of IAPP in diabetic subjects has been found thus far. but much more work is necessary to define its normal secretory rates and clearance. Other proposed actions of IAPP include serum calcium-lowering effects and smooth muscle relaxation; the latter effect might promote the uptake of insulin into the circulation within the islets. Deposition of amyloid is species selective due to structural differences within the central part of the molecule and may be initiated intracellularly in type II diabetes by several mechanisms. No differences in the structure of IAPP or its precursor have been found in individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young or type II diabetes.',\n",

The initial survey for this study was done in 1952. Follow-up surveys of respondents were done in 1960. 1968. 1976. and 1984. The present study used all subjects who responded fully to activity and health questions in 1976 and who were reported as either dead or alive (not lost to follow-up) in 1984. A total of 348 subjects (185 ATH. 163 N-ATH) were assessed and caloric expenditure groups were established by kilocalories (kcal) of aerobic exercise per week; 0 kcal (group 1). 1-399 kcal (group 2). 400-899 kcal (group 3). 900-1499 kcal (group 4). 1500-2499 kcal (group 5). and 2500+ kcal (group 6).

An animal study, Management of severe laryngotracheal stenosis requires treatment with open laryngeal surgical approaches. Performing the necessary anterior. and possibly posterior. incisions to expand the cricoid and tracheal rings causes instability of the segments. Placing an intraluminal stent has several disadvantages. ranging from injury of healthy tissue to airway obstruction. The availability of an external stent would avoid many of these complications. We performed expansion laryngeal surgery in dogs and explored the use of microplates for external fixation and determined the surgical outcome if no fixation is used. The results show that microplates are very effective in maintaining external fixation and that a need for placing an intraluminal stent when a posterior cricoid split is performed exists.',\n",

Other features of the renal failure were an 84-fold increase in urine beta 2-microglobulin excretion (from 0.19 to 16.0 micrograms.min-1) and a much smaller increase in urine total protein excretion (from 0.07 to 0.18 mg.min-1) during the post-race period. Post-race creatinine clearance remained below pre-race levels throughout the study. varying between 42.8 and 72.9 ml.min-1. in contrast to the post-race 49% increase in the remaining runners (from 138.1 +/- 12.9 to 205.5 +/- 59.9 ml.min-1).

On one third of the 554 baseline angiograms of study patients enrolled in and whose eyes were graded in the study as of January 31. 1990. the Reading Center staff has noted an unusual pattern of hyperfluorescence in the late-transit frames that has not been described previously. This pattern. which we call \"loculated fluid.\" consists of a well-demarcated area of hyperfluorescence that appears to represent pooling of fluorescein in a compartmentalized space anterior to the choroidal neovascular leakage. Although the loculated fluid may conform to a pattern of typical cystoid macular edema. it can also pool within an area deep to the sensory retina in a shape that does not bear any resemblance to cystoid macular edema.

       " '15, Haemopoietic growth factors, The availability of recombinant haemopoietic growth factors has permitted more precise in vitro experiments and human in vivo studies to be performed. In general. the results have been in accord with expectations from previous in vitro studies. The clinical exploitation of the haemopoietic growth factors offers great promise but careful studies are required to define their value. The effects of some growth factors are multiple and complex. and it cannot be assumed that improvements in blood cell counts are per se beneficial to the patient under all circumstances. Randomized controlled trials with clinical end-points are now essential. In the situation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. large studies would be required to show an improvement in mortality although lesser morbidity would be easier to demonstrate. In the field of cancer therapy the major benefit of the haemopoietic growth factors will be if they permit dosage escalation and there is a consequent improvement in response rate and long-term survival. This will require careful patient selection and large. probably multicentre. trials. It is also likely that such studies will be limited by the development of severe thrombocytopenia and an effective means to ameliorate this (perhaps the elusive thrombopoietin) will be required. The possibility of using haemopoietic growth factors as an adjunct to the treatment of severe infections is enticing. but designing a trial to evaluate this possibility is fraught with difficulties. Finally. it must be noted that all the studies reported to date use single factors. This is just the beginning and the use of other factors and synergistic combinations may give greater efficacy without increased toxicity.',\n",

Ten children had 18 episodes of erysipelas-like erythema which proved to be specific for the disease. Twelve children (26 per cent) had 31 episodes of non-specific purpuric rash and six children (13 per cent) had nine episodes of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other manifestations included diffuse erythema of the face. and/or trunk. angioneurotic oedema. diffuse erythema of the palms and soles followed by mild desquamation of the skin. Raynaud's phenomenon and a subcutaneous nodule. The mean frequency of the cutaneous lesions was 1.6/patient/year before colchicine therapy and 0.4/patient/year after colchicine therapy (p = 0.0005). The high incidence of cutaneous manifestations and their response to colchicine strongly suggest that skin involvement is an integral part familial Mediterranean fever.\",\n",
       " '10, A simple method to improve the accuracy of non-invasive ultrasound in selecting TIA patients for cerebral angiography, A prospective study is reported of the ability of B mode ultrasound imaging and continuous wave Doppler flow studies to detect different degrees of stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) in 186 arteries in 99 patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and minor ischaemic stroke. A simple mathematical equation has been developed which combines the image and flow data to provide a single predictor of the degree of angiographic stenosis which has advantages over either ultrasonic modality used alone. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model in the detection of stenosis greater than or equal to 25% was 73% and 98%. of stenosis greater than or equal to 50% was 90% and 93%. of stenosis greater than or equal to 75%. 65% and 99% and occlusion 100% and 94% respectively. The principal clinical value of ultrasound screening is to spare patients with \"non-significant\" stenosis the risk of unnecessary angiography. Thus a simple measure of the Duplex screening tests\\' performance is the proportion of all strokes occurring as a complication of angiography that are avoided by changing the investigation policy from \"angiograms for all carotid TIA and minor ischaemic stroke patients\" to \"angiograms for all patients with abnormal ultrasound results\". If Duplex scanning were used to select patients most likely to have a significant abnormality on angiography. depending on the degree of stenosis to be detected. 52-85% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. If the predictive equation were used 62-88% of angiographic strokes might be avoided.',\n",

A series of 60 patients admitted consecutively to a stroke unit were assessed on tests of motor. functional and cognitive abilities at admission. On the basis of these assessments predictions were made about the abilities of the patients at discharge. Patients were assessed for level of motor abilities and activities of daily living at discharge and the accuracy of the predictions checked. Predictions were found to be significantly correlated with outcome but the relationships were not so close as to be useful for the clinical management of individual patients.',\n",

The central motor conduction time was significantly increased in the MS group compared to controls (p less than 0.05). Damage to both the upper and lower motor neuron pathways can contribute to sphincter disturbance in MS. The latter may be due to coexisting pathology or to involvement of the conus medullaris by MS.',\n",

Serum and CSF vitamin B12 concentrations showed a positive correlation. In individual patients CSF B12 concentrations varied considerably for a given serum concentration. The median serum vitamin B12 concentration of the Alzheimer's type dementia group was significantly lower compared with that of a control group. Lower median CSF vitamin B12 concentrations were found in groups of patients with multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's type dementia. Five patients with heterogeneous clinical pictures had unexplained low serum and CSF B12 concentrations without macrocytosis. Two patients had very high serum B12 and low-normal CSF concentrations which could be explained by a blood-brain barrier transport defect. Serum and CSF folate concentrations did not show significant differences between the various groups.\",\n",

There were 65 patients who had cordotomies for painful forms of cancer. Thirty eight had necropsy examination with histological investigation of the spinal cord. No form of mechanoreception was removed in any of the 65 patients and in the majority no forms of tactile sensibility were altered by division of the pathways in the anterolateral and anterior columns. In no case was graphaesthesia affected. Knowledge of joint position and movement and awareness of vibration was normal in 62 of the 65 patients. But information carried by these anterolateral pathways does reach neural levels of consciousness. for with total lesions of the posterior columns. previously reported. touch and pressure are still felt. Itch was removed by division of the anterolateral pathways. Although the posterior columns are essential for discrimination in mechanoreception. discrimination may be disturbed by lesions of the anterolateral pathways. notably two-point discrimination. The evidence on the pathways essential for conveying impulses giving rise to tickle was inconclusive.',\n",

In group 1. anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies were detected in eight patients (38%). in titres from 1:1000 to 1:32.000. A small cell lung cancer was present in six patients. ovarian cancer in one patient and in one patient no tumour could be detected. The neurological symptoms preceded a diagnosis of cancer in five out of eight patients. Anti-neuronal antibodies were found in the serum of two out of 94 patients (2%) from control group 3 but not in serum from any of the other control groups. These data indicate a moderate sensitivity of 38%. but a high specificity of 98.6% (95% confidence interval 95.5-99.8%) for the presence of anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies if a paraneoplastic NS disorder is suspected.',\n",
       " '10, Spectral analysis of tremor: understanding the results, Spectral analysis of a tremor record can sometimes produce a spectrum with multiple components of significant amplitude. The problem is to determine whether the presence of several peaks represents the coexistence of separate tremor mechanisms or be a consequence of fluctuations in the frequency or amplitude of a single tremor. The spectrum of a tremor whose frequency or amplitude vary and are independent has the recognisable pattern of a central carrier frequency with sidebands of equal amplitudes distributed symmetrically around the carrier. However. if tremor amplitude and frequency fluctuate and are not independent. (frequency proportional to amplitude or frequency inversely proportional to amplitude). the spectrum has a pattern of sidebands which are asymmetrical in amplitudes and may resemble the spectrum of the combined signal from different independent oscillators. The investigation of sidebands in spectra has been neglected in tremor studies and multiple irregular peaks on a tremor spectrum have sometimes been used wrongly as evidence for the coexistence of multiple tremor mechanisms or frequency components assumed to be concurrent.',\n",
       " '21, Lumbosacral evoked potentials and vesicourethral function in patients with chronic suprasacral spinal cord injury, Persistent detrusor acontractility despite normal somatic reflex activity in some patients with high spinal cord injury is an enigma. Previous work has suggested disordered integration of afferent activity in sacral roots or the sacral spinal cord. Forty male patients with chronic stable suprasacral cord lesions were studied by filling and voiding videocystometrography. and recording lumbosacral evoked potentials from posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Only five of 15 patients with decreased detrusor contractility had abnormal lumbosacral evoked potentials. Similar abnormalities were found in four of 11 patients with efficient hyperreflexic bladders. The finding of normal lumbosacral evoked potentials in the majority of patients with suprasacral cord injuries and decreased detrusor contractility supports the argument that the pathophysiology of this specific form of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is multifactorial.',\n",

Thirty-six percent of patients had a noncardiac operation during the first month after the cardiac operation. The mortality rate was 11%. and the morbidity rate was 56%. The statistical comparison of the predictive accuracy of postoperative complications of three simple. widely used classifications (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status. New York Heart Association classification. Massachusetts General Hospital cardiac risk index) demonstrated the superiority of the simplified three-class cardiac risk index (Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index; predictive accuracy of 84%). In a multivariate discriminant analysis of 21 variables in this population. five variables (myocardial infarction in previous 6 months. S3 gallop or jugular vein distention. arrhythmia on last preoperative electrocardiogram. emergency operation. delay between cardiac and noncardiac operation) were identified as being the most predictive of a postoperative complication. When these variables were used in the function (DF3) obtained by linear discriminant analysis. the prediction accuracy of a postoperative complication reached 83%. Performance of the new models in a prospective validation population remained satisfactory (75% for Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index three-class index and 72% for DF3). Extensive statistical analysis of our data tested by a validation study provided simple predictive models based on clinical variables easily available even in emergency situations.',\n",
       " '14, Intraoperative coronary artery endarterectomy with excimer laser, Compared with continuous-wave lasers. excimer lasers exhibit several in vitro advantages: nonthermal ablation process and linear relation between the number of pulses and the depth of the crater. A 308 nm. 20 nsec pulse duration. 1 to 5 repetition rate laser was specifically designed for clinical application. At the time of cardiopulmonary bypass in 10 symptomatic patients. before bypass grafting. a 1 mm diameter core specifically ultraviolet-tipped fiberoptic scope was introduced via the coronary arteriotomy and placed upstream (seven patients) and downstream (three patients) in contact with the stenosis. Laser power was increasingly delivered up to the clearing of the stenosis or occlusion. Quality of angioplasty was controlled by calibration of the neolumen. cardioplegic solution output through the laser-treated segment. and an eighth day or sixth month coronary arteriogram. In the first three patients studied on the eighth day. all laser-treated coronary artery segments showed an early parallel-linked patent neolumen despite competitive bypass graft flow. In the patients studied after 6 months. all recanalized segments were patent except one; in one patient the venous graft was occluded. but the upstream laser angioplasty was patent. The main limitation of the method lies in the fact that laser coronary recanalization is confined to the fiber core diameter. We conclude that (1) excimer laser angioplasty may be safe and efficient during surgical procedure and (2) as catheter flexibility remains the most critical problem. we are now assuming an appropriate tool with a multifiber system that is suitable for intraoperative as well as percutaneous routes.',\n",

Minnesota. 107 incidence cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma (in 46 male and 61 female patients) were diagnosed during the years 1950 through 1985. Overall crude incidence rates were 6.0 and 6.6 per 100.000 males and females. respectively. Evaluation of trends in 9-year periods showed that the rates increased from 3.2 to 8.9 for males (P = 0.015) and from 4.4 to 11.7 for females (P less than 0.001). Age-specific rates suggested that the highest incidence occurs in the age-groups 50 to 59 years and 70 years or older for males and 40 to 49 years and 70 years or older for females. Lesions were most common in the head and neck area among males (P = 0.044) and on the lower extremities among females (P = 0.018). The most frequent histologic type was superficial spreading melanoma (61%). Five-year survival was diminished overall for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma--0.72 in comparison with 0.88 expected for the general population. Statistically significant risk factors for survival were depth of invasion of the lesion (Clark level). thickness of the lesion. histologic type. and age of the patient.',\n",

Traditionally. clinicians have thought that most cases were due to lung carcinomas and that the clinical manifestations differed from those for pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. We report two cases of corticotropin-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors that were clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Review of the literature revealed that bronchial carcinoid tumors are the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic secretion of corticotropin. On biochemical and anatomic studies. they are frequently indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome and thus may be difficult to diagnose. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling for corticotropin and computerized imaging of the chest may be the best aids in making the diagnosis.\",\n",

In this article. we discuss the current rehabilitative techniques used at the Mayo Clinic for athletes who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. These techniques are based on established principles of rehabilitation. clinical experience. and new information about the related biomechanics of the knee. An illustrative case reflects the benefits of this rehabilitation program. which lasts up to 1 year and is divided into five stages. The early stages focus on protected mobilization and a strengthening program that emphasizes closed rather than open kinetic chain exercises. Later. neuromuscular-proprioceptive training and sport-specific agility training redevelop the reaction time and the \"coordination engrams\" necessary for athletic competition. High-quality surgical care and a closely supervised rehabilitation program. based on kinesiologic and biomechanical factors as they pertain to the anterior cruciate ligament. are necessary for a successful outcome.',\n",

Ten patients were randomly assigned to a 6-month interferon regimen. and 10 patients were assigned to a 3-week interferon trial. Eleven patients (five assigned to long-term treatment and six to short-term treatment) did not complete interferon therapy: eight had either severe thrombocytopenia or neutropenia; one had pronounced fatigue in relationship to administration of interferon; one had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and sepsis and died; and one had a massive fatal variceal hemorrhage during interferon therapy. Most of the serious hematologic complications occurred in patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism. In one patient. seroconversion to hepatitis B virus DNA negativity occurred before the onset of treatment. Four of the five patients able to complete the 6-month interferon regimen and only one of four patients able to complete the 3-week trial had seroconversion to hepatitis B virus DNA negativity. Thus. we conclude that the therapeutic response was better among patients who were able to complete a 6-month interferon trial. In patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism. development of either severe thrombocytopenia or leukopenia associated with interferon therapy precluded completion of treatment.',\n",
       " '10, Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography: clinical applications in cerebrovascular disease, Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was introduced in 1982 as a noninvasive procedure for assessment of the intracranial cerebral circulation. The lightweight and portable equipment used for transcranial Doppler examination facilitates its use in the bedside assessment of critically ill hospitalized patients and outpatients. Clinical applications include the diagnosis of vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. assessment of intracranial collateral flow in patients with extracranial arterial occlusive disease. detection of intracranial arterial stenosis. identification of the feeding arteries of arteriovenous malformations and monitoring the hemodynamic effects of their treatment. confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of brain death. intensive-care unit monitoring of brain-injured patients. and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of neurosurgical patients. Transcranial Doppler technology is also providing new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of a variety of cerebrovascular conditions. Clinicians will find transcranial Doppler technology most helpful if they have a specific question about the status of the intracranial circulation. Further investigations may expand the clinical and research utility of this technology.',\n",

Patients were divided into one of three groups: those with a normal-sized uterus; those with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm); and those with uterine fibroids. which had been documented clinically. ultrasonographically. or by a combination of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy or by one or the other. All patients were considered candidates for hysterectomy.

After treatment. 68% of patients with normal-sized uterus and 91% of patients with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm) and 88% of patients with uterine fibroids became amenorrheic or had light flow. None of the patients in this last group have had to undergo hysterectomy. This study indicates that the patient with an enlarged or fibroid uterus may not have contraindications for endometrial ablation. Endometrial ablation may be effective in at least temporarily controlling bleeding in those patients with enlarged or myomatous uterus.',\n",

Concentric beams of near-monochromatic x-ray photons may be generated by collision of the free electron laser (FEL) electron beam with the optical beam in an interaction zone that delivers the x-rays to a shirtsleeve environment. The absence of Compton scatter and the photoelectric interaction within tissues improves conspicuity of lesions by two to six times. Increased attenuation of x-rays in malignant vs. normal tissues makes tumors more obvious. K-edge subtraction allows chemical analysis of tumors in vivo--all at radiation doses that are one-tenth to one-fiftieth that delivered by the lowest-dose mammographic x-ray technique available. This allows for an increased sensitivity and specificity and permits prediction of histology. negating necessity for biopsies. Selective bond-breaking at depth in tissues as well as x-ray-activated photodynamic therapy are also being explored.',\n",

Preferential retention of the photosensitizer by malignant tissue has been considered a hallmark of this treatment modality. However. photosensitivity can be observed in normal. non-neoplastic tissues. and the present study investigated the effects of PDT treatment on the abdomen of intact rats. A circular region (1 cm diameter) on the shaved abdomen of Fischer rats. pretreated 24 h prior with Photofrin II. was irradiated for 30 min at 632 nm. Control animals received either photoradiation or Photofrin II administration. Subsequent lesions were observed in the irradiated skin. its associated abdominal wall. and the underlying gut in rats receiving Photofrin II and laser irradiation. All tissues were not equally sensitive to PDT treatment. Gut lesions were consistently more severe than were skin and abdominal wall injuries. By 24 hr after treatment. the gut manifested a transmural hemorrhagic necrosis. while the irradiated skin and abdominal wall were edematous. with an inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis and around occasional swollen myocytes. These results indicate that superficial lesions induced by PDT may not be reliable indicators of the extent of deeper PDT tissue damage. Further. it may be possible to take advantage of this discrepancy in tissue sensitivity and treat deep tissues through less sensitive superficial tissues.',\n",

Sonomicrometry assessed myocardial fiber shortening and radioactive microspheres were used to estimate baseline regional blood flows. Cardiopulmonary bypass was followed by cardioplegia arrest. Laser channels (1 mm diameter) were made every 3 to 5 mm in the LAD region with an 80 watt Laser-sonics CO2 unit. Bypass was terminated. the LAD occluded. and parameters reassessed. Core samples of myocardium from the lased LAD and control circumflex area were taken to assess adenine nucleotides. After occlusion.

In polychotomous logistic regression analyses. low education increased risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46) and regular use of multivitamin supplements decreased risk (OR = 0.63) for all cataract types. Dietary intake of riboflavin. vitamins C. E. and carotene. which have antioxidant potential. was protective for cortical. nuclear. and mixed cataract; intake of niacin. thiamine. and iron also decreased risk. Similar results were found in analyses that combined the antioxidant vitamins (OR = 0.40) or considered the individual nutrients (OR = 0.48 to 0.56). Diabetes increased risk of posterior subcapsular. cortical. and mixed cataracts (OR = 1.56). Oral steroid therapy increased posterior subcapsular cataract risk (OR = 5.83). Females (OR = 1.51) and nonwhites (OR = 2.03) were at increased risk only for cortical cataract. Risk factors for nuclear cataract were a nonprofessional occupation (OR = 1.96). current smoking (OR = 1.68). body mass index (OR = 0.76). and occupational exposure to sunlight (OR = 0.61). Gout medications (OR = 2.48). family history (OR = 1.52). and use of eyeglasses by age 20 years. which is an indicator of myopia (OR = 1.44). increased risk of mixed cataract.

       " '23, Effects of inflammation and copper intake on rat liver and erythrocyte Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase activity levels, Stress such as inflammation produces an acute phase response that includes elevated levels of ceruloplasmin. the main copper component of plasma. Inflammatory effects on cellular copper enzyme activity levels are largely unknown. Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in liver. the main site of ceruloplasmin secretion. decreased with turpentine-induced inflammation (0.1 mL. intramuscular. leg) in rats fed any of three copper levels (adequate = 6 mg/kg. marginal = 2.5 mg/kg and deficient less than 0.5 mg/kg). Ceruloplasmin activities rose significantly with inflammation in the adequate and marginal groups but not in the deficient animals. Hepatic Cu-Zn SOD immunoreactive protein levels were unaffected by copper status or inflammatory state. Erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities were influenced by dietary copper but not inflammation. An additional group of rats fed 15 mg copper/kg did not show a turpentine-induced decrease in liver Cu-Zn activity levels. Inflammatory effects on other copper enzyme activities did occur as evidenced by increases in ceruloplasmin and decreases in serum extracellular SOD. In conclusion. an acute phase response in rats increased the amount of dietary copper required to maintain hepatic Cu-Zn SOD activity at levels equal to those of nonstressed. copper-adequate rats. Rat erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities provided a blood measurement reflective of copper intake with or without stress. but these values did not reflect decreases in liver Cu-Zn SOD activities after 3 d of inflammation.',\n",

Chromatin 1.25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1.25-(OH)2D3] receptor concentration in the intestinal mucosa decreased 20-30%. and the percentage of occupied receptors decreased from 12-15% to 6-8%. Receptor affinity for 1.25-(OH)2D3 did not change (Kd = 0.24-0.26 nmol/L. Kd2 = 0.06-0.10 nmol/L). but the cooperativity coefficient decreased from 1.7 to 1.4. Vitamin C deficiency potentiated effects of vitamin D deprivation and impaired a restorative action of vitamin D. It was accompanied by a marked delay in the elevation of 25-OHD concentration in serum as well as decreased 1-OHase activity in kidneys and a lower concentration of occupied 1.25-(OH)2D3 receptors in the intestinal mucosa.

N = 11) as compared with those with a relatively slow rate of progression (\"benign PD\"; duration of symptoms greater than 4 years. N = 65). Comparisons of tremor-dominant PD (mean tremor score/mean PIGD score less than or equal to 1.5. N = 441) with the PIGD-dominant type (mean tremor score/mean PIGD score greater than or equal to 1.0. N = 233) provided support for the existence of clinical subtypes. The PIGD group reported significantly greater subjective intellectual. motor. and occupational impairment than the tremor group. Stage II patients had higher depression scores than stage I patients. Among the patients participating in the DATATOP. older age at onset with bradykinesia. or with the PIGD form of PD. is associated with more functional disability than when the symptoms are dominated by tremor or begin at a younger age.',\n",
       " '23, Poloxamer 407 as an intraperitoneal barrier material for the prevention of postsurgical adhesion formation and reformation in rodent models for reproductive surgery, Comtemporary adhesion-prevention regimens for infertility surgery emphasize the use of barrier materials to effect physical separation of injured surfaces before reperitonealization. Poloxamer 407 is a biocompatible polymer that displays reverse thermal gelation characteristics; that is. the material exists as a liquid at room temperature and as a solid at body temperature. These properties make it an ideal material for use in laparoscopic surgery. The antiadhesion properties of poloxamer 407 were evaluated in two models. In the first experiment. Golden hamsters were subjected to a standardized adhesion-producing lesion in the left uterine horn. Poloxamer solutions in concentrations ranging from 15-35% were applied to the injured horn. Location. thickness. and extent of adhesion formation were assessed 14 days later. Significant reduction in post-traumatic adhesion formation was observed following treatment with the 30-35% solutions. The second experiment was designed as a paradigm of the typical situation encountered in infertility surgery: prevention of adhesion reformation after lysis of established adhesions. New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to three laparotomies at 14-day intervals for placement of the adhesion-producing lesion. evaluation (prescore) and surgical lysis of induced adhesions. and subsequent evaluation of adhesion reformation (post-score). The effect of applying poloxamer 407 after adhesiotomy was compared with controls (no treatment). Adhesion reformation (post-score) was markedly reduced by poloxamer-407 treatment. Further trials of this material in the clinical setting are indicated.',\n",

One hundred twenty-two GIFT cycles were initiated in 59 women over 18 months. Seventy-three tubal transfers were performed. resulting in seven clinical pregnancies. a rate of 9.6% per transfer. This contrasts with a 27.3% clinical pregnancy rate per transfer in women under 40. Thus. older patients require thorough counseling regarding the decreased likelihood of success despite the use of assisted reproductive technologies.',\n",

Cases of hemorrhage were defined by a hematocrit decrease of 10 points or more between admission and post-delivery or by the need for red-cell transfusion. Patients with antenatal bleeding were excluded. Among 9598 vaginal deliveries. postpartum hemorrhage occurred in 374 cases (3.9%). Three controls were matched to each case and multiple logistic regression was used to control for covariance among predictor variables. Factors having a significant association with hemorrhage were prolonged third stage of labor (adjusted odds ratio 7.56). preeclampsia (odds ratio 5.02). mediolateral episiotomy (4.67). previous postpartum hemorrhage (3.55). twins (3.31). arrest of descent (2.91). soft-tissue lacerations (2.05). augmented labor (1.66). forceps or vacuum delivery (1.66).

Detection rates with different combinations of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). hCG. and unconjugated estriol (uE3) were established by retrieving and analyzing 54 serum specimens from women with confirmed Down syndrome pregnancies. compared with 657 specimens from women with normal outcomes. With a risk cutoff of 1:270 at the second trimester. the detection rate with MSAFP. hCG. and uE3 was two to three times higher than with MSAFP alone. With all three markers. the detection rate for Down syndrome increased from 50 to 77% as maternal age increased. and was 60% in a representative screened population. If uE3 was omitted. the detection rate decreased from 60 to 48%. One thousand women were screened prospectively. either with MSAFP or with all three markers prospectively. either with MSAFP or with all three markers and 4.1% with MSAFP. With the three markers. the positive predictive value for Down syndrome was 2.2% overall and as high as 5.9% in older women. Therefore. the addition of hCG and uE3 to the maternal serum screen increases the positive predictive value by 50-300%. depending on maternal age. These results confirm the efficacy of screening for Down syndrome using maternal age and three serum markers.',\n",

No subjects were readmitted to the hospital for recurrent endometritis and there were no wound infections or recurrent fevers. Minor side effects were seen in 10% of those taking amoxicillin and 14% of those taking placebo. Compliance was fair; only 52% of those taking amoxicillin and 65% of those taking placebo completed therapy. The lack of infectious complications in this high-risk population suggests that oral antibiotic therapy is unnecessary after successful IV antibiotic therapy for endometritis.',\n",
       " '16, Third-trimester fetal death in triplet pregnancies, During the last decade. 89 sets of triplets were born in Denmark with a gestational age of more than 25 completed weeks. Fifteen pregnancies (16.9%) were complicated by fetal death in the third trimester. with a total of 17 intrauterine deaths. Six neonatal deaths occurred. leaving 22 survivors among these 15 patients. Four triplet gestations were diagnosed as twins until delivery. Eight women conceived spontaneously. two gestations followed assisted fertilization and embryo transfer. and five women had had various forms of ovulation stimulation. The mean maternal age was 27.8 years (range 17-38). Seven women were parous and eight wer nulliparous. Maternal complications included hydramnios (three). preeclampsia/hypertension (three). and anemia (nine). All women delivered preterm. Of the 11 gestations diagnosed as triplets. fetal death was diagnosed at 32.2 +/- 2.9 weeks (mean +/- SD) and delivery occurred at 32.6 +/- 3.0 weeks. Nine of 11 women had cesarean deliveries. Continuation of pregnancy after fetal death could be considered in only three subjects. In eight women. obstetric reasons required immediate delivery. Fetal death was associated with monochorionic or dichorionic placentation. and growth retardation was a frequent complication before fetal death. Anencephaly of one fetus. umbilical cord problems in two. and severe hydrops in two were the only obvious causes of fetal death. Fetal death should not be the sole indication for delivery. In cases with severe prematurity and a stable intrauterine situation. frequent assessments of fetal well-being are recommended. with prompt delivery when indicated.',\n",
       " '12, Multilocular cysts of kidney. A study of 29 patients and review of literature, Multilocular renal cyst is a distinct renal tumor whose gross external appearance and absence of normal renal tissue within the septa of loculi distinguish it clearly from other renal cystic lesions. Interlocular septa may contain either (1) fibrous tissue alone or (2) embryonic tissue separating adjacent loculi. Of 29 patients with multilocular renal cysts. 24 underwent a renal-sparing procedure. and only 5 had radical nephrectomy. None of the histologic specimens showed evidence of immature renal tissue or neoplasia. Patients were followed from three months to eight years (mean. 39 months). and no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease was found. Because it is difficult to distinguish multilocular renal cyst from cystic Wilms tumor and multicystic clear cell carcinoma on the basis of imaging studies alone. surgical intervention is the only effective method to differentiate multilocular renal cyst from a malignant lesion of the kidney.',\n",
       " \"13, Reduced frequency of hypertensive disorders in placenta previa, The isthmic segment of the uterine artery's ascending branch has a freer course and wider diameter than distal parts of the vessel. Therefore. we assumed that this arterial segment would provide better blood flow and prevent hypoxia of the trophoblast. As a result. placenta previa pregnancies would be complicated by hypertensive disorders less often than are pregnancies with normally implanted placentas. To test this hypothesis. 491 placenta previa pregnancies. among a population of 106.866 pregnant women. were compared with pregnancies with normally implanted placentas. Clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in the rates and risks of hypertensive disorders were found in placenta previa pregnancies (P = .002. relative risk = 0.44. 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.78). The differences persisted when primiparous and multiparous women were examined separately and when preterm and term deliveries were separated. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis. patients with placenta previa had a third of the risk for hypertensive disorders compared with pregnant women with normally implanted placentas (relative risk = 0.36. 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.64). even after controlling for parity and preterm or term delivery. In the same model. primiparity and preterm delivery were each associated with a doubling of risk for hypertensive disorders. regardless of the placental implantation site. Thus. regardless of parity and preterm or term delivery. placenta previa and hypertensive disorders are inversely related.\",\n",
       " '23, Factors associated with hemorrhage in cesarean deliveries, A case-control study was performed to study risk factors for hemorrhage in cesarean deliveries. Hemorrhage was defined by a pre- to post-delivery hematocrit decrease of 10 points or more or by the need for red-cell transfusion. Patients with antenatal bleeding were excluded. Among 3052 cesarean deliveries. hemorrhage occurred in 196 cases (6.4%). Three controls were matched to each case and multiple logistic regression was used to control for covariance among predictor variables. Factors having a significant association with hemorrhage were: general anesthesia (adjusted odds ratio 2.94). amnionitis (odds ratio 2.69). preeclampsia (2.18). protracted active phase of labor (2.40). second-stage arrest (1.90). and Hispanic ethnicity (1.82). After adjustment for these variables. a classic uterine incision had a small but significant association (odds ratio 1.06) with hemorrhage. Previous cesarean. parity. gestational age. and several other factors had no association with hemorrhage. These data allow one to anticipate hemorrhage in patients at risk and may be useful in planning appropriate use of blood bank resources. including antepartum autologous blood donation.',\n",

A new clinicopathologic entity in genesis of male infertility and its treatment by epididymopexy, Mobile epididymis plays an important role in the genesis of male infertility. It constituted 9 percent of a consecutive series of idiopathic infertility. Of 200 patients examined (100 fertile and 100 infertile). mobile epididymis was detected in 9 infertile patients. The clinical picture is characteristic. Epididymis is widely separated from testicle and moves freely from side to side. Its body and tail are ill formed and the epididymovasal angle is obtuse. Azoospermia was persistent in 3 patients and intermittent in 6 patients. Testicular biopsy showed tubular dilatation. Epididymopexy was performed in the 9 patients to fix the epididymis to testicle: 3 patients showed improvement in semen quality with two resultant pregnancies. Failures were due to advanced testicular damage. Infertility in mobile epididymis appears to result from obstruction of efferent ductules. testicular ischemia. and/or interference with sperm maturation. transport. or delivery.',\n",

One hundred fifty-five intermediate care female patients with a mean age of 85.5 years were identified as being incontinent of urine at least once daily. After urologic evaluation. each patient was classified into one of four categories: incontinence with normal cystometrogram 68 (44%). detrusor instability (DI) 52 (34%). stress incontinence (SI) 27 (17%). or overflow incontinence (OI) 7 (4%). Thirteen weeks later. patients were again studied using simple water cystometry. At follow-up evaluation. 45 patients (33%) had urodynamic findings which differed from the initial evaluation. Of these women. 10 with DI. 12 with SI. and 2 with OI were found to have normal cystometric parameters at the time of follow-up study. while 19 (14%) who initially had normal cystometric findings had evidence of DI (11) or SI (3). Strong correlation between urinary incontinence in patients with normal cystometric findings and moderate to severe cognitive impairment was present. Simple urodynamic evaluation did identify patients with SI and OI who might benefit from specific therapy. Urodynamic evaluation of incontinent elderly female nursing home patients is indicated and may provide direction for planning treatment strategies.',\n",

All of the patients had a previous history of recurrent superficial disease. and 41 (75%) were treatment failures following other intravesical therapy. Thirty-six (66%) patients responded to treatment. and 19 (34%) were treatment failures. Twenty-seven (66%) of 41 patients with cTa-cT1 tumors and 9 (64%) of 14 patients with cTis responded. with a mean follow-up period of 30.5 months.

Patients with a history of three or more previous events of tumor recurrence. positive urinary cytology. and multicentric disease. all fared worse than patients without these characteristics (p less than 0.05). BCG is an effective agent in controlling superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. even in a high-risk group of patients who failed previous intravesical therapy.

There was a total of 565 such cases in a population which consisted of 5.2 X 10(5) individuals in 1972 and 4.8 X 10(5) individuals in 1987. The introduction of H2-receptor antagonists in 1979 was associated with a fall in the annual incidence of elective duodenal ulcer operations. from 15.5 to 6.7 per 10(5) individuals. and a fall in the annual incidence of elective gastric ulcer operations. from 9.4 to 3.1 per 10(5) individuals (P less than 0.05). The decrease was greatest among males with duodenal ulcer. In contrast. the annual incidence of emergency surgery for ulcer haemorrhage and perforation (all types of ulcers) remained relatively stable. varying from 7.2 to 10.2 per 10(5) inhabitants over the observation period (n.s.). The mean age of patients undergoing elective surgery remained essentially unchanged. The mean age of patients undergoing emergency surgery increased. The decrease in the annual incidence of elective duodenal ulcer surgery occurred mainly in relation to proximal gastric vagotomy. There was a concomitant relative increase in the incidence of gastric resection. The types of operative procedures used in cases of pyloric. prepyloric and gastric ulcer remained unchanged over the years 1972 to 1987.',\n",
       " \"6, Gastric adaptive relaxation and symptoms after vagotomy, Gastric adaptive relaxation is reported to be impaired after vagotomy. This abnormality has been implicated in the pathogenesis of postvagotomy symptoms. but no association has previously been demonstrated between the two. Gastric adaptive relaxation was measured in 15 healthy volunteers and 33 patients more than 1 year after highly selective vagotomy or truncal vagotomy and drainage. Seventeen patients were asymptomatic. The remainder were symptomatic including seven patients with persistent diarrhoea. Fasted subjects were intubated with a Ryle's tube containing a pressure microtransducer within a flaccid (800 ml) plastic bag. Gastric corpus-fundus pressure was recorded during distension of the bag with air (15 ml/s) over 30 s. Pressure indices were derived from the areas under the pressure curves. Median (range) pressure indices were: healthy volunteers 12.7 (7.5-17.1) cmH2O. highly selective vagotomy 14.0 (9.8-15.9) cmH2O (n.s.). truncal vagotomy and drainage 14.5 (8.6-26.8) cmH2O (P = 0.04). All patients with diarrhoea had abnormally high pressure indices (P less than 0.001). Pressure indices in all other patient groups were within the normal range. We conclude that gastric adaptive relaxation remains abnormal in patients with postvagotomy diarrhoea but not in those who are asymptomatic or who have other symptoms.\",\n",

In the clinical abscess cavities. phenytoin application in 20 patients compared with conventional treatment in 20 patients resulted in earlier separation of slough. decrease in oedema. control of pain and overall enhanced healing. The mean(s.d.) rate of reduction of wound area was 2.02(0.48) cm2/day in the phenytoin group versus 1.58(0.51) cm2/day in controls (P less than 0.05) on day 10. and 1.8(0.32) cm2/day versus 1.19(0.21) cm2/day (P less than 0.01) on day 20. The mean volume reduction rates at both the 10th and 20th day were 0.48(0.01) cm3/day for phenytoin versus 0.32(0.04) cm3/day for controls; (P less than 0.005). By day 20. 17 of the patients treated with phenytoin were rated as having healed completely. compared with only one of the controls. In a standardized guinea-pig model of the clinical abscess cavity. which included inoculation of the wound with Bacillus proteus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. an enhanced healing rate was also observed (at 7 days 0.40(0.05) cm2/day with phenytoin versus 0.21(0.08) cm2/day in controls; P less than 0.005). All eight of the animals treated with phenytoin healed by day 21. compared with one of the eight controls.

Of these. 372 patients had surgery over 10 years ago. Three hundred and forty-two patients survived for more than 10 years and. in a prospective study. 305 were reviewed. forming the basis of this 10-20-year follow-up report. Forty-six (15 per cent) have had recurrent ulceration; 80 per cent of these developed symptoms within 5 years and no patient has had recurrence after 13 years. Although 29 patients required reoperation for recurrent ulceration. the current patient satisfaction rate for Visick grades I and II is 92 per cent. Only two patients required reoperation because of gastric stasis. It is concluded that proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe and satisfactory first choice operation for duodenal ulceration.',\n",

In extensive intra-abdominal tumour recurrence the omentum is invariably involved. The importance of the omentum in the development of tumours at sites of intra-abdominal trauma has been investigated. Colonic anastomoses were performed in Hooded-Lister rats with and without omentectomy. Animals received intraluminal or intraperitoneal injections of a syngeneic tumour. With intraluminal injection. tumour occurred at the anastomosis and in the omentum in 38 and 43 per cent of animals respectively but following omentectomy the values were 14 and 9 per cent (omental remnant). With intraperitoneal administration tumour occurred in 53 per cent at the anastomosis and in 79 per cent in the omentum compared with 16 and 29 per cent (in omental remnant) following omentectomy. In this model a reduced ability of an anastomosis to support 'seeded' tumour following removal of the omentum is demonstrated and the development of local recurrence from spilled tumour cells during operation may be enhanced by. or be dependent on. the proximity of the omentum.\",\n",

This risk is exacerbated by the fibrinolytic shutdown which is known to occur after major surgery. Stanozolol. which has been demonstrated to enhance endogenous fibrinolysis. was therefore used in an attempt to prevent this perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown and so enhance graft patency. Twenty-seven patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg stanozolol or placebo intramuscularly 24 h before operation. followed by a 6 week course of either 5 mg stanozolol or placebo orally. twice daily. On the second day after operation. 10-11 MBq of autologous 111indium-labelled platelets were injected. with scanning over the graft on the 3 following days. Despite using a large depot of stanozolol. significant effects. such as raised plasminogen (P less than 0.001). reduced fibrinogen (P less than 0.001) and reduced euglobulin lysis time (P less than 0.001). were not seen until the seventh day after operation. with maximum benefit at 6 weeks. This was reflected in the 111indium-labelled platelet deposition studies. The placebo group had a progressive increase in platelet deposition on all 3 days. In contrast. those receiving stanozolol showed a lower. static picture of deposition. However. these changes did not attain statistical significance. Three patients experienced early graft thrombosis. two in the placebo group and one in the stanozolol group. Only an incomplete inhibition of the perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown was achieved. Much longer preoperative courses are thus required to allow the maximum effect to be present at the most crucial time. At present. perioperative fibrinolytic enhancement does not appear to be a practical proposition. and we must await the development of new safer and more potent agents.',\n",

Thyroid hormone therapy failed to suppress the TSH level. The TSH level was unresponsive to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) administration. alpha-subunits of pituitary glycoproteins were undetectable in her plasma. and imaging of the pituitary-hypothalamic region was normal. Measurement of TSH with an assay containing sheep antibody to TSH failed to reveal TSH in the patient's plasma. Addition of mouse IgG to the TSH fluoroimmunoassay reduced the patient's TSH to an undetectable level. These observations are consistent with a spurious elevation of TSH due to the presence of an anti-mouse antibody. Artifactual elevations of TSH have not been identified commonly. but this possibility should be considered when the TSH level is inappropriate for the apparent state of thyroid function.\",\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with a diagnosis of PLL or CLL-Pro received fludarabine 30 mg/m2 over 30 minutes daily for 5 days every 4 weeks alone (12 patients). or with prednisone (five patients). Previously defined criteria for response were used. Differences in response rates according to various characteristics were evaluated by chi-square test. RESULTS: Three patients (18%) achieved complete remission. and three (18%) had a partial remission. for an overall response rate of 35%. Responses were durable and occurred in all involved organ sites. Lower response rates were observed in patients with anemia. thrombocytopenia. advanced Rai stages. and primary resistance to prior therapy. Toxicities were minimal except for febrile episodes associated with therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 59 patients who had received 131I between 1979 and 1989. The patients were divided into two groups. depending on the extent of their previous surgical thyroid excision. Group 1 comprised 10 patients with a lobectomy or hemithyroidectomy before the ablative radioiodine dose. and Group 2 comprised 49 patients with more extensive thyroid excision (near-total or subtotal thyroidectomy) before the radioiodine treatment. RESULTS: Sixty percent of the 10 patients in Group 1 experienced some degree of neck pain or tenderness following radioiodine ablation of their residual thyroid. In one case. the local reaction was very severe and accompanied by the development of transient hyperthyroidism. There was only a 6% local complication rate in the patients who had undergone more extensive thyroid excision before ablative therapy (p less than 0.001). and none had a severe reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with only unilateral surgical excision before radioiodine therapy have a higher rate of local complications than do patients treated with more extensive surgery prior to radioiodine ablation. If radioiodine is to be employed in such patients. they should be informed of this possible complication. Since evidence supports a dose effect in the pathogenesis of the complications. we recommend using a dose of less than 30 mCi for the initial ablation in these patients even though it may be necessary to repeat this dose to complete thyroid ablation.',\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the care of 170 patients with CHF enrolled in one of eight Medicare HMOs with the care of 191 similar FFS patients. Panels of expert physicians developed criteria for evaluating quality of care. and specially trained nurse clinicians abstracted medical records. RESULTS: Outpatient evaluation and management were similar in both settings. although HMO patients were significantly more likely to be advised to restrict salt intake. However. FFS patients with uncontrolled hypertension were more likely to have their medication regimens changed (62% versus 36%. p less than 0.01). Ejection fractions were obtained equally as often. and inpatient management was similar for both groups. Nonetheless. HMO providers scheduled follow-up visits within 1 week of hospital discharge more often (42% versus 27%. p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that financial incentives of prepaid care are not detrimental to most aspects of care for CHF patients. More rapid follow-up after hospital discharge for patients with CHF suggests that HMOs may be more effective in delivering continuity of care for patients with chronic illness.',\n",

The first step is transition from normal to impaired glucose tolerance. for which insulin resistance is the main determinant. and the second and later step is worsening from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. in which beta-cell dysfunction plays a critical role. This hypothesis is consistent with findings from other ethnic groups from many parts of the world.\",\n",
       " \"14, Comparison of labetalol versus enalapril as monotherapy in elderly patients with hypertension: results of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, PURPOSE: This study compared the safety and efficacy of labetalol and enalapril as antihypertensive therapy for elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized. open-label. parallel controlled trial was conducted. After completing a 4-week placebo phase. 79 elderly (65 years or older) patients with an average standing diastolic blood pressure (BP) 95 mm Hg or above and 114 mm Hg or less were randomized to receive a 12-week course of either labetalol or enalapril in an open-label design. The patients' BP and heart rate were evaluated biweekly by trained observers unaware of the treatment status. and drug dosage was titrated (up to 400 mg twice a day of labetalol or 40 mg daily of enalapril) to achieve a standing diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline. Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo phase and again after 8 weeks of active treatment. RESULTS: The treatment groups were comparable in their reduction of supine diastolic BP. with no significant differences between the two treatments. Labetalol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in standing diastolic BP at the end of the titration period compared to enalapril. but this difference was not significant by the end of the study period. Based on 24-hour ABPM readings. labetalol reduced mean 24-hour diastolic BP (p less than 0.05) and mean heart rate (p less than 0.05) more than enalapril. The labetalol-treated patients were significantly less often above their diastolic BP goal throughout the 24-hour ABPM period (p less than 0.01). The two treatments were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that labetalol and enalapril are equally effective in lowering supine diastolic BP in the elderly. but labetalol is more effective in lowering ambulatory BP and heart rate throughout the day.\",\n",
       " '14, Prognostic significance of valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis, PURPOSE: Doppler ultrasound is a sensitive modality for detecting and quantitating valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis. Because valvular regurgitation leads to heart failure. we evaluated the prognostic significance of Doppler-detected valvular regurgitation in patients with endocarditis who had not yet developed clinical heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 65 patients with a clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis from May 1985 to March 1990. A total of 49 patients were included in the study: 33 patients with native valve endocarditis and 16 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. The initial Doppler echocardiogram was examined in these patients to determine the presence and degree of valvular regurgitation. RESULTS: Significant (moderate to severe) valvular regurgitation was detected in 23 (47%) patients. The presence or absence of significant valvular regurgitation did not predict the development of congestive heart failure. the need for surgery. or death (p = NS). The development of congestive heart failure was significantly associated with the need for surgery (p less than 0.0001) and death (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the detection of significant valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis who have not yet developed heart failure is not predictive of future complications nor does the absence of significant valvular regurgitation identify a group of patients with a more favorable prognosis. In our series. patients who developed congestive heart failure had a significantly higher incidence of surgery and death. Therefore. decisions regarding clinical management in patients with infective endocarditis should not be made solely on the presence or absence of echocardiographically detected valvular regurgitation.',\n",
       " '15, Idiopathic neutropenia: antineutrophil antibodies and clinical correlations, PURPOSE: The present study was done to evaluate the clinical characteristics of a large series of adult patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. and correlate the presence of antineutrophil antibodies. their class (IgG or IgM). and their ability to fix complement with clinical parameters. including other hemocytopenias. splenomegaly. and infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one adult patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia were studied. Serum neutrophil-binding antibodies were measured using paraformaldehyde-fixed granulocytes (PFGs) from normal volunteers as target cells. 125I-labeled staphylococcal protein A was used to detect IgG antibodies while IgM antibodies were detected by using 125I-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-IgM antibody. Sera containing antineutrophil antibodies were tested for their ability to fix complement on donor PFGs by using 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody to the third component of complement. RESULTS: Of the 121 patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. 71 patients had isolated neutropenia. while 50 had neutropenia combined with either anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Among the 71 patients with isolated neutropenia. there were 51 females (72%). compared with 28 females (56%) among the 50 patients with combined hemocytopenias (p = 0.083). Patients with multiple hemocytopenias were significantly older (p less than 0.01). were more likely to demonstrate splenomegaly (p = 0.001). and may have had more infectious complications. From all the patients. 36% of sera were shown to have antineutrophil antibodies. with a non-significant trend for these to be found more frequently in patients with multiple hemocytopenias. Sera with mixed IgG-IgM antineutrophil antibodies were significantly more likely to fix complement than those with isolated IgG or IgM antibodies. and among the patients with antineutrophil antibodies. complement-fixing antibodies were significantly associated with multiple hemocytopenias. Splenomegaly was significantly associated both with antineutrophil antibodies (p = 0.008) and with infections (p = 0.007). Antineutrophil antibodies were not associated with infections. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of adult patients with idiopathic neutropenia have IgG and/or IgM antineutrophil antibodies demonstrable in their serum. There is a subset of patients with idiopathic neutropenia with multiple hemocytopenias who tend to be older. less likely to show female predominance. more likely to have splenomegaly and infections. and more likely to have antineutrophil antibodies. especially mixed IgG-IgM and complement-fixing antibodies.',\n",
       " \"15, Results of bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures from adult sickle cell disease patients with the acute chest syndrome, PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of the acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease based on bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures and to describe the clinical. laboratory. and roentgenographic features of the acute chest syndrome in a series composed entirely of adult patients with sickle cell disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the hospital records from 19 episodes (18 patients) of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease (greater than or equal to 19 years of age) who had undergone flexible bronchoscopy to obtain lower airway cultures between January 1979 and July 1987. We also recorded patients' clinical. laboratory. and roentgenographic characteristics. RESULTS: Pneumonia was diagnosed in four of 19 episodes (21%) of acute chest syndrome based on quantitative cultures obtained at bronchoscopy. The pneumonia was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in two patients and mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the other two patients. Forty-four of 45 blood cultures were negative. and one grew Staphylococcus epidermidis. which was considered a contaminant. Chest roentgenograms revealed lower lobe involvement in 17 episodes (90%) and bilateral infiltrates in six (32%). Pleural effusions occurred in seven episodes (37%). and pleural fluid samples obtained from five of these revealed sterile exudates. CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective study suggest that bacterial pneumonia is an uncommon cause of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease. These results are consistent with previous retrospective studies using noninvasive techniques to diagnose pneumonia. Nevertheless. there appeared to be no reliable noninvasive variables that could accurately differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia and. consequently. we recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in addition to usual supportive care of these patients.\",\n",
       " '23, Effective doses of epidural morphine for relief of postcholecystectomy pain, Having previously established the effective dose of intrathecal morphine for relief of postcholecystectomy pain. we determined in this study the effective dose of epidural morphine for relief of postcholecystectomy pain in 154 patients given epidural injections of a placebo (group 1. n = 49). 2 mg morphine (group 2. n = 54). or 4 mg morphine (group 3. n = 51) intraoperatively mixed in 1.5% lidocaine. The percentage of patients who did not request an analgesic. 30 mg IM pentazocine. for relief of pain during the first 24 postoperative hours was significantly greater in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1. In patients who did need 30 mg IM pentazocine postoperatively. the number of times pentazocine was administered was also significantly greater in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. The percentage of patients developing respiratory depression or vomiting in the first 48 postoperative hours was similar in the three groups. Based on the present data and those we previously reported for intrathecal morphine. we conclude that an epidural morphine dose of 2-4 mg and an intrathecal morphine dose of 0.06-0.12 mg are equipotent for relief of postcholecystectomy pain.',\n",
       " '23, Efficacy of ephedrine in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting, Although reported in the aerospace literature and anecdotally by anesthesiologists. the putative antiemetic effect of ephedrine remains unquantitated. We therefore prospectively studied ephedrine as an antiemetic agent in the perioperative setting in 97 patients undergoing general anesthesia for outpatient gynecologic laparoscopy. Patients were assigned in a double-blind randomized fashion to receive a standardized general anesthetic followed by an intramuscular dose of either ephedrine (0.5 mg/kg). droperidol (0.04 mg/kg). or saline before the conclusion of surgery. Nausea. retching. or vomiting. as well as the degree of sedation and discharge times. were assessed in the recovery room and for 24 h postoperatively. Ephedrine was found to have a significantly antiemetic effect (P less than 0.05) when compared with placebo and an antiemetic effect similar to that of droperidol. Sedation scores were also significantly less in the ephedrine group than in both placebo and droperidol groups. Finally. variations in mean arterial blood pressure among the three groups were not statistically significant. We conclude that ephedrine is an effective antiemetic agent with minimal sedative side effects in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopy.',\n",
       " '17, Epidural morphine with butorphanol for postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery, Epidural morphine has been used more and more to provide long-lasting postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery. However. the incidence of pruritus (20%-93%) and nausea (17%-60%) detract from the usefulness of epidural morphine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate. in 30 patients having epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. the analgesic efficacy and side effects when a combination of epidural morphine. a mu-receptor agonist. and butorphanol. a mu-receptor antagonist and kappa-receptor agonist. was administered. After clamping of the umbilical cord. patients received 4 mg epidural morphine with 3 mL of normal saline (group 1). 4 mg epidural morphine with 1 mg butorphanol and 2 mL of normal saline (group 2). or 4 mg epidural morphine with 3 mg butorphanol (group 3). Patients were monitored for 24 h after administration of the study medications. There were no significant differences between the groups in visual analogue pain scores. time to first analgesic request. respiratory rate. or Trieger dot test performance in the 24 h immediately after these epidural injections. There were three patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2 who experienced oxygen saturations less than 90%. (No patients in group 3 developed an oxygen saturation less than 92%.) The patients in group 3 did not require treatment for pruritus or nausea. a response significantly different (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05. respectively) from group 1 or group 2.',\n",
       " '23, A blinded comparison of noninvasive, in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test in the evaluation of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal. anesthetic-induced syndrome. Currently. the only accurate means of diagnosing susceptibility to this syndrome is the testing of biopsied skeletal muscle for its contracture response to halothane and caffeine. A less invasive means of diagnosis is needed. The authors previously reported that MH-susceptible patients studied by in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy demonstrated a higher resting inorganic phosphate (Pi) to phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio in their skeletal muscle. as well as a slower postexercise recovery of PCr/Pi. when compared to normal controls. In the present blinded study. the authors compared in vivo 31P NMR determination of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi in forearm muscles to in vitro halothane/caffeine contracture test results in 42 patients. Forty-three control subjects were studied to establish normal NMR values of resting Pi/PCr and recovery rate of PCr/Pi. Their findings were compared with those of 27 patients shown to be MH-susceptible and 15 patients MH-negative by contracture testing. The MH-susceptible group had a significantly (P less than 0.005) higher resting Pi/PCr value (0.202 +/- 0.044) than either the MH-negative (0.152 +/- 0.043) or the control (0.141 +/- 0.026) group. The MH-susceptible group also had a significantly (P less than 0.02) slower postexercise recovery rate of PCr/Pi (1.50 +/- 0.872 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) than either the MH-negative (2.11 +/- 1.07 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) or control (2.25 +/- 0.828 PCr.Pi-1.min-1) group. Twenty-six of the 27 MH-susceptible patients demonstrated abnormal NMR test results (a resting Pi/PCr greater than or equal to 0.18 or recovery rate less than 1.0 PCr.Pi-1.min-1). and 13 of the 15 MH-negative patients had normal NMR results. Although neither NMR parameter alone was diagnostically reliable. an NMR test utilizing both parameters was quite accurate. The NMR test and contracture test demonstrated an overall agreement of 93% with a copositivity of 96% and conegativity of 87%. The sensitivity and specificity of the NMR test is estimated to be 98.8% +/- 11.8% and 95.3% +/- 20.3%. respectively. The role of 31P NMR in the diagnosis of MH susceptibility and possible mechanisms underlying the observations are discussed.',\n",

Women with phenylketonuria (PKU) not treated prior to conception can have a pregnancy that results in serious fetal damage. In this report. factors associated with preventing unplanned (and hence late treated) pregnancies are described. METHODS. Subjects included 60 phenylketonuric women and two comparison groups composed of female acquaintances and diabetic women. All were interviewed and administered tests of intelligence. general well-being. knowledge. and personality. RESULTS. Thirty-five percent of the sexually active women with PKU used contraception only sporadically. The variables that best predicted reported frequency of birth control use were the extent to which women felt social support to use contraception (r = .64) along with positive attitudes about birth control (r = .66) and knowledge of family planning (r = .43). For the comparison groups. a different pattern of variables predicted contraceptive use. with locus of control figuring most prominently for the diabetics (r = .39) and social support for birth control being most important for the acquaintances (r = .46). CONCLUSIONS. As more girls with PKU enter childbearing ages. there will be an increased need for specific programs that address psychosocial factors in maternal PKU.',\n",

The hypothesis that spontaneous EMG activity changes with time was assessed. During the chronic phase evaluation. a conduction study was performed to rule out peripheral nerve damage. and the amount of reflex activity was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = areflexia; 5 = greater than 5 beats of clonus) to estimate the amount of spasticity. Subjects demonstrated normal conduction through the sensory (sural nerve) and/or motor segments of the peroneal and tibial nerves. In the acute phase. each muscle had spontaneous activity with no significant variation between different muscles of the same patient. In the chronic phase. there was a positive correlation between the degree of spontaneous activity in a muscle and the length of its axon (p less than .01) and a negative correlation between the amount of spontaneous activity and the degree of reflex activity (p less than .01). Specifically. the lower motor neuron in the chronic phase of an SCI seems to behave much like an axonopathy where the degree of spontaneous EMG activity is dependent on the length of the axon. with the additional concept that spontaneous activity is inhibited by spasticity.',\n",

This research was guided by two competing theoretical formulations. According to bottom-up theory. older adults first assess feelings of satisfaction within specific life domains that are based in part on the experiences (i.e.. stressors) they encounter in these areas. The domain-specific views are subsequently synthesized to form an overall sense of satisfaction with life as a whole. In contrast. the top-down theory suggests that a person's ongoing sense of satisfaction with life as a whole predisposes him or her to assess satisfaction with specific domains in ways that are congruent with his or her initial sense of global life satisfaction. Analysis of data provided by older participants in a nationwide survey tends to support the bottom-up perspective.\",\n",

All victims suffered massive maxillofacial trauma with associated ocular. cranial. intracranial. and extremity injuries. Two patients died. both because of intracerebral hemorrhage. One patient suffered serious long-term disability. All survivors required extensive reconstructive surgery. The design of the multipiece tire rim is inherently hazardous.

However. a centrally located fistula with early visualization of the trunk of the portal vein persisted in one patient and necessitated transcatheter embolization. The APF in this patient caused portal dilatation which was detectable by CT scan. We conclude that spontaneous closure can be expected when an APF is located peripherally and the shunt flow is small. while centrally located APF with large flow require active treatment. preferably by transcatheter embolization. An APF detectable by CT scan suggests the need of intervention.',\n",

POPULATION: A convenience sample of emergency physicians. emergency nurses. and emergency medical technicians (EMTs). METHODS: A survey instrument eliciting demographic and work-related factors was developed and administered; survey items included age. sex. occupation. years in occupation. number of procedures performed per week. number of contaminated needlestick (and other \"sharps\") injuries recalled. and number of these injuries formally reported during the previous five years. Nonsegmented visual analog scales were used to assess eight attitudes possibly associated with nonreporting. Analysis was by analysis of variance and multiple linear regression with stepwise variable election. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-nine subjects recalled 643 contaminated exposures during the five-year study period. but only 228 (35%) were formally reported. One or more injuries occurred in 55% of EMTs compared with 72% of nurses and 80% of physicians (P less than .05). Physicians recalled a mean of 3.8 contaminated exposures. whereas nurses recalled 2.8 and EMTs recalled only 1.8 (P less than .05). Physicians formally reported a mean of 0.26 exposures. whereas EMTs reported 0.85 and nurses reported 1.25 (P less than .05).

       " '10, Emergency department approach to managing seizures in pregnancy, Seizures in pregnancy pose risks for both the mother and the fetus and must be managed aggressively. Antiepileptic drugs have some teratogenic potential. but the risks are not as profound as reported in earlier literature. There is definitely less risk to the fetus from anticonvulsant exposure than from uncontrolled seizures. The evaluation of a pregnant woman with new-onset seizures is the same as for the nonpregnant patient. including head computed tomography with appropriate abdominal shielding. Status epilepticus management is based on IV benzodiazepines. phenytoin. or phenobarbital. Good fetal outcome is dependent on rapid seizure control. Management of eclampsia is controversial. There is little evidence that magnesium sulfate has anticonvulsant properties. and its use as such will probably decline steadily in the future. At present. it is reasonable to manage eclamptic seizures in the same way that status epilepticus is managed.',\n",

The Dutch Working Party on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of renal transplantation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and end-stage renal failure and to compare disease activity after transplantation with disease activity before transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective case finding using data for an 8-year period from the central registry for renal replacement therapy in The Netherlands. SETTING: Tertiary care hospitals with facilities for renal transplantation in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight patients who fulfilled at least four of the American Rheumatology Association's criteria for the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus and who received a renal transplant. MEASUREMENTS: Actuarial survival rates for grafts and patients after transplantation. maximal nonrenal scores on the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. and time-adjusted disease exacerbation rates in all patients before and after transplantation. RESULTS: The actuarial graft survival rate at 1 year and 5 years was 68% (95% CI. 47% to 82%) and 54% (CI. 25% to 77%). respectively. whereas the actuarial patient survival rate was 87% (CI. 69% to 96%) at 1 and 5 years. High disease activity was not found to affect graft survival adversely before the start of renal replacement therapy or during dialysis. After transplantation. disease activity per patient and the overall incidence of disease exacerbations decreased. One case of recurrent lupus nephritis was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and end-stage renal failure are excellent candidates for renal transplantation; disease activity after transplantation is sporadic and low. and the recurrence of lupus nephritis is rare.\",\n",

Undiagnosed and untreated pulmonary embolism has a high mortality rate; thus. a high index of clinical suspicion and reliable diagnostic modalities are necessary to ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis. We report the case of a patient with severe central pulmonary embolism with a normal ventilation-perfusion scan. The embolus was identified by a nuclear pulmonary flow study using dynamic imaging. which obviated the need for contrast pulmonary angiography. The traditional ventilation-perfusion scan may appear normal despite severe central pulmonary embolism. In this situation. early dynamic imaging is necessary to detect severe obstruction of the central pulmonary arteries. This approach may obviate the need for contrast pulmonary angiography in hemodynamically stable patients.',\n",
       " '18, Archaeology of NIDDM. Excavation of the \"thrifty\" genotype, Since the 1940s. numerous cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have been observed in certain American Indian populations. Extremely high prevalence rates of NIDDM occur most strikingly in several tribes of Paleo-Indians. whose ancestors migrated to North America greater than 11.000 yr ago. Archaeological evidence from that period indicates that certain groups of Paleo-Indians maintained an arctic-like hunter-gatherer life-style in an area in temperate North America ranging from Wyoming to Arizona. This life-style featured a reliance on unpredictable big game species as a major food source. However. at this time. big game species were becoming extinct. It is hypothesized that those Paleo-Indians who relied on big game as a food source developed a \"thrifty\" genotype that allowed a selective advantage during the periods of fasting that occurred between big game kills. It also is hypothesized that this thrifty genotype in these Indians may contribute to NIDDM when a sedentary life-style is adopted and food sources are constant. Because insulin resistance in muscle is a major feature of NIDDM. it is possible that insulin resistance per se is the phenotypic expression of the thrifty genotype.',\n",

The same findings may be associated with sepsis. Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HTR. although a mechanism for neutrophil activation has not been shown. In addition. the possible role that cytokines may play in HTR has not been investigated. We show that interleukin-8 (IL-8). a cytokine with chemotactic and neutrophil-activation properties. is produced in whole blood following addition of ABO-incompatible red blood cells. in a dose- and time-dependent manner related to the degree of hemolysis. and is inhibited by inactivation of complement. IL-8 production is accompanied by increased gene expression in the buffy coat. This observation has implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of and for the treatment of HTR.',\n",

The initial diagnoses were chronic active hepatitis in three cases and \"granulomatous cholangitis\". inflammatory pseudotumour. and anaplastic carcinoma in one case each. Moreover. extensive haemorrhagic necrosis in three cases initially suggested the Budd-Chiari syndrome. All the tumours were diffuse non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas like the 50 cases reported previously. but they differed from most of these in that nine were of T cell phenotype. Five were pleomorphic small T cell. two T zone. and two T lymphoblastic lymphomas: only one was centrocytic and of B cell lineage. This report extends the range of clinical manifestations (diffuse hepatomegaly without a tumour). histological appearances (resemblance to chronic inflammatory or vascular liver diseases) and phenotype (of T cell lineage) of primary lymphoma of the liver: these features seemed to be related in this series. Recognition is important as prognosis remains favourable in appropriately treated cases. Although the appearances of the liver biopsy specimens may be difficult to interpret. the destructiveness of the infiltrate is an important clue to the diagnosis.',\n",

These patients were compared with age- and sex-matched but otherwise unselected general dermatology out-patients. Using the Beck depression inventory. significantly more patients with generalized pruritus (32.4%) had depressive symptomatology (score greater than 14) than controls (13.2%. P less than 0.05). Although more patients with chronic urticaria had depressive symptomatology (14.7%) than controls (4.4%). the difference was not statistically significant. Using the Speilberger state-trait anxiety inventory there were no significant differences between the patients with pruritus or urticaria and their controls with respect to state or trait anxiety scores above the upper 90% probability limit for the general population. Thus. significant depression may be expected in a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic generalized pruritus but in a relatively small proportion of those with chronic urticaria.',\n",

Two patterns of distribution were recognizable: (a) diffusely spread through the tumour and (b) located mainly at the periphery of the tumour. These did not correlate with the diagnosis of melanoma or Spitz naevus and the distribution appeared to be a function of growth pattern of the tumour.

The tumours specifically bound oestradiol. This binding almost exclusively resulted from the presence of high numbers of type II oestrogen binding sites. Oestrogen receptors were absent or present at very low concentrations. Immunohistochemical investigation of nuclear oestrogen receptors gave negative results. This indicates that antioestrogen receptor antibodies recognise oestrogen receptors but not type II oestrogen binding sites. The presence of specific type II oestrogen binding sites and progesterone binding offers further evidence for a potential role for these steroids and their receptors in colorectal carcinoma.',\n",

       " '5, Anterior tibial translation during a maximum quadriceps contraction: is it clinically significant, Quadriceps exercises are used sparingly in the early rehabilitation of ACL reconstructions because of concern about prematurely stretching the ACL graft. The aim of this study was to determine if a maximum isometric quadriceps contraction significantly translates the tibia anteriorly at 15 degrees. 30 degrees. 45 degrees. 60 degrees. and 75 degrees of flexion. Secondly. the role of the ACL in knee stability was analyzed by comparing the amount of tibial translation in normal. ACL deficient. and reconstructed knees. Thirdly. the location in the motion arc where a quadriceps contraction produces anterior tibial translation was determined. Anterior tibial translation was measured using an arthrometer (KT-1000) during an 89 N and manual maximum translation applied to the knee at rest. The manual maximum translation test determines the magnitude of anterior tibial translation produced by a high anterior force applied directly to the proximal calf. These translations were compared to the tibial translation intrinsically induced by a quadriceps contraction. Testing was performed in normal (N = 22). ACL deficient (N = 10). and reconstructed (N = 10) knees. Anterior tibial translation produced by a maximum quadriceps contraction was measured at 15 degrees. 30 degrees. 45 degrees. 60 degrees. and 75 degrees of flexion. The extension exercise resulted in less anterior tibial displacement than an 89 N drawer and half the translation produced by a manual maximum translation (P less than 0.001). Instrumented laxity testing produced greater anterior translation of the tibia than a maximum isometric quadriceps contraction. Anterior tibial translation was the same during maximum isometric knee extension in all tested knees.',\n",
       " '4, Influence of chromosomal integration on glucocorticoid-regulated transcription of growth-stimulating papillomavirus genes E6 and E7 in cervical carcinoma cells, In most cervical carcinoma cells the E6 and E7 genes of specific human papillomaviruses are transcribed from viral sequences integrated into host cell chromosomes. Glucocorticoids activate the promoter elements of various human papillomaviruses in transient-expression assays. We have analyzed the effect of dexamethasone on the transcription rate of human papillomavirus 18 E6 and E7 genes integrated at different chromosomal sites in four cervical cancer cell lines. Dexamethasone led to an increase in the transcription rate of the integrated E6-E7 sequences in C4-1 and C4-2 cells but led to a decrease in SW 756 cells and did not affect the transcription rate in HeLa cells. However. when the viral promoter elements derived from HeLa or SW 756 cells. in which dexamethasone does not activate transcription of the integrated E6-E7 sequences. were tested in transient-expression assays within the same cell lines. dexamethasone consistently activated the viral promoter. It thus appears that dominant regulatory mechanisms presumably depending on the chromosomal integration site are able to override the response of the viral promoter to steroid hormones. The growth rate of all dexamethasone-treated cell lines correlated consistently with the expression of the papillomavirus E6 and E7 genes. supporting their role in the maintenance of the proliferative phenotype of cervical carcinoma cells. Since human papillomaviruses are integrated into the host cell genome at variable. presumably randomly selected chromosomal loci. regulatory mechanisms that influence viral gene expression. and hence cell growth. may differ among cancers of independent clonal origin.',\n",

For this reason. the authors have analyzed the status of 25 children with spastic cerebral palsy before and after rhizotomy to determine the effects of this therapy on muscle tone. range of movement. and motor function. Postoperative tests showed a reduction in muscle tone compared with preoperative assessments. Range of motion in the lower extremities was significantly increased and improvements in functional gross motor skills were noted. An increase in range of motion in the knees and thighs during gait was detected in 18 ambulatory patients studied with computerized two-dimensional motion analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that selective posterior rhizotomy reduced spasticity. thereby increasing range of motion and contributing to improvements in active functional mobility.',\n",

Treatment of these children with growth hormone (GH) has been suggested and sporadically implemented. We. therefore. studied the effect of human GH (hGH) and its by-product insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on the growth of leukemic cells in vitro. Under serum-free conditions hGH and IGF-1 induced a significant dose-dependent proliferative effect on promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) and Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi) cell lines. Anti-hGH antibodies negated the stimulatory effect of hGH and anti-IGF-1 serum abrogated the growth-promoting effect enhanced by IGF-1. Similar statistically significant stimulatory properties were found when freshly obtained marrow cells from four of five acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of childhood and four acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients were studied in ALL and AML blast-cell clonogenic assays. ALL colonies increased numerically by 72% (P less than .025) and AML colonies by 92% (P less than .01) in the presence of hGH at concentrations of 2.5 x 10(2) and 3.0 x 10(2) ng/mL. respectively. IGF-1 stimulated ALL and AML blast-colony growth at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 ng/mL by up to 105% (P less than .025) and 65% (P less than .03). respectively. Our in vitro data suggest that circulating hGH and IGF-1 may promote leukemic blast cell replication in vivo. and the supplemental administration of hGH to leukemia patients in remission must be carefully monitored for early relapse.\",\n",

The experiments were performed on skinned fibers from the soleus. gastrocnemius lateralis. and plantaris muscles isolated from Wistar rats. A reduction in fiber diameter might explain the decrease in the maximal tension in the soleus. whereas this tension was unaltered in the gastrocnemius and the plantaris. Moreover the calcium sensitivity of the myofilament appeared modified in the soleus and in the gastrocnemius: The tension/pCa relationships were shifted toward higher calcium concentrations. indicating a decrease in the apparent calcium binding constant of the troponin C. The tension/pCa relationship appeared unaltered in the plantaris after spaceflight. Finally. the studies of the time to reach a steady tension indicated an increase in the rate of force development in the soleus and. on the contrary. a slowing down in the plantaris. No change in the gastrocnemius was found. The results were analyzed with references to the different muscle functions in disuse atrophy.',\n",
       " '18, Pretranslational suppression of a glucose transporter protein causes insulin resistance in adipocytes from patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity, A major portion of insulin-mediated glucose uptake occurs via the translocation of GLUT 4 glucose transporter proteins from an intracellular depot to the plasma membrane. We have examined gene expression for the GLUT 4 transporter isoform in subcutaneous adipocytes. a classic insulin target cell. to better understand molecular mechanisms causing insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity. In subgroups of lean (body mass index [BMI] = 24 +/- 1) and obese (BMI = 32 +/- 2) controls and in obese NIDDM (BMI = 35 +/- 2) patients. the number of GLUT 4 glucose transporters was measured in total postnuclear and subcellular membrane fractions using specific antibodies on Western blots. Relative to lean controls. the cellular content of GLUT 4 was decreased 40% in obesity and 85% in NIDDM in total cellular membranes. In obesity. cellular depletion of GLUT 4 primarily involved low density microsomes (LDM). leaving fewer transporters available for insulin-mediated recruitment to the plasma membrane (PM). In NIDDM. loss of GLUT 4 was profound in all membrane subfractions. PM. LDM. as well as high density microsomes. These observations corresponded with decrements in maximally stimulated glucose transport rates in intact cells. To assess mechanisms responsible for depletion of GLUT 4. we quantitated levels of mRNA specifically hybridizing with human GLUT 4 cDNA on Northern blots. In obesity. GLUT 4 mRNA was decreased 36% compared with lean controls. and the level was well correlated (r = + 0.77) with the cellular content of GLUT 4 protein over a wide spectrum of body weight. GLUT 4 mRNA in adipocytes from NIDDM patients was profoundly reduced by 86% compared with lean controls and by 78% relative to their weight-matched nondiabetic counterparts (whether expressed per RNA. per cell. or for the amount of CHO-B mRNA). Interestingly. GLUT 4 mRNA levels in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (BMI = 34 +/- 4) were decreased to the same level as in overt NIDDM. We conclude that. in obesity. insulin resistance in adipocytes is due to depletion of GLUT 4 glucose transporters. and that the cellular content of GLUT 4 is determined by the level of encoding mRNA over a wide range of body weight. In NIDDM. more profound insulin resistance is caused by a further reduction in GLUT 4 mRNA and protein than is attributable to obesity per se. Suppression of GLUT 4 mRNA is observed in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. and therefore. may occur early in the evolution of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).',\n",

Several other abnormalities. especially growth deficiency. were frequent but not constant. Chromosome analysis showed deletion of band 17p13 in 14 of 25 MDS probands. RFLP and somatic cell hybrid studies using probes from the 17p13.3 region including pYNZ22 (D17S5). pYNH37 (D17S28). and p144-D6 (D17S34) detected deletions in 19 of 25 probands tested including seven in whom chromosome analysis was normal. When the cytogenetic and molecular data are combined. deletions were detected in 21 of 25 probands. Parental origin of de novo deletions was determined in 11 patients. Paternal origin occurred in seven and maternal origin in four. Our demonstration of cytogenetic or molecular deletions in 21 of 25 MDS probands proves that deletion of a \"critical region\" comprising two or more genetic loci within band 17p13.3 is the cause of the MDS phenotype.

We report the finding of a substitution at nucleotide position 4041 of the CF gene. resulting in a change from asparagine to lysine at amino acid position 1303. We believe that this is a disease-causing mutation. as it involves a nonconservative amino acid change and has only been found on CF chromosomes with a consistent haplotype background. The mutation was detected using direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA and was confirmed by dot hybridization to both normal and mutant allele-specific oligonucleotides.

In vitro teicoplanin had a higher intrinsic activity than vancomycin did; and it also had a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. resulting in higher peak concentrations in plasma. a longer elimination half-life. and a larger area under the concentration-time curve than those of vancomycin. To predict the antibacterial efficacies of the drugs in vivo on the basis of their activities in vitro and pharmacokinetics. a mathematical model was applied. In the model the in vitro effect was expressed as the difference in growth rate between control cultures and those in the presence of the antibiotic (ER). and the in vivo effect was expressed as the difference between numbers of CFU in control and antibiotic-treated animals (EN). The integral of ER against time. ERt. was calculated by using the concentrations found in vivo. A significant linear relationship was found between EN and ERt for different dosages at the same times (4 h) after drug administration as well as for the same doses at consecutive times. although at the lowest doses of teicoplanin the observed effect was less than the predicted effect.',\n",

Effect of superoxide dismutase, This study assesses the effect of the superoxide anion scavenger superoxide dismutase on myocardial capillary permeability-surface area (PS) products for small hydrophilic molecules after ischemia and reperfusion. Open-chest dogs underwent a 20-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. Myocardial plasma flow rate and capillary extraction of chromium 51-labeled EDTA or technetium 99m-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid were measured by the single-injection. residue-detection method before ischemia and 5 and 60 minutes after the start of reperfusion. In 13 dogs. no scavenger treatment was given (nonprotected control group). whereas eight dogs were treated systemically with 15.000 units/kg superoxide dismutase during 1 hour. starting 20 minutes before ischemia. In the control group. three dogs developed reperfusion ventricular fibrillation in contrast to none in the superoxide dismutase group. Before ischemia. plasma flow rate. myocardial capillary extraction fraction. and PS values were similar in the two groups. Five minutes after the start of reperfusion. plasma flow rate increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in both groups. In the control group. capillary extraction fraction increased by 12% (p = NS) in spite of the higher plasma flow; these increases in capillary extraction fraction and plasma flow induced a 69% increase in PS (p less than 0.01). In the superoxide dismutase-treated group. capillary extraction fraction decreased by 32% (p less than 0.05) in accordance with the increased plasma flow rate. resulting in an unchanged PS (p = NS). Sixty minutes after reperfusion. plasma flow rate. capillary extraction fraction. and PS returned to preocclusion values in both groups (p = NS). The increased capillary extraction fraction and PS values seen in the control group suggest an increased capillary permeability after ischemia and reperfusion.

Chest radiographic findings and other laboratory data including pulmonary function tests did not correlate with the survival rate. These findings suggest that mucous hypersecretion as well as neutrophils and eosinophils in BALF are among the determinants of prognosis in patients with chronic IPF.',\n",

Uganda were studied and correlated with the serologic reactivity to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of these patients. Two-thirds of the patients with tuberculosis were HIV-seropositive. Histories of fever and weight loss were more prominent in HIV-seropositive patients. and perihilar and basilar infiltrative diseases were more frequently seen in HIV-seropositive patients. Although all patients responded similarly to drug therapy. cutaneous drug reactions were seen in nearly one-third of HIV-seropositive patients receiving thiacetazone.',\n",
       " '21, Cumulative load as a risk factor for back pain, The association between cumulative load (biomechanic load and exposure time integral over the entire work experience) and back pain was investigated in a group of institutional aides with physically stressful jobs. A questionnaire/interview was conducted with 161 of these institutional aides. The point prevalence of back pain in this sample was 62%. Men had worked a mean duration of 14.3 years and women 11.6 years at the time of the onset of the first pain episode. Every job performed was analyzed by the use of a two-dimensional static mathematical model. The compression and shear at the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral discs were computed by the use of a biomechanic model. Cumulative compression and shear were significantly higher in institutional aides with pain compared with those without pain (P less than 0.05-0.01). The pain group was similar to the no-pain group in age. weight. and height.',\n",
       " \"20, Morphometry of the airways during late responses to antigen challenge in the rat, To quantitate the structural changes in the airways that contribute to the late bronchial response (LR) to antigen challenge we killed six Brown-Norway rats. sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) and challenged by aerosol. during the LR and compared the dimensions of the intraparenchymal airways with those of six control animals. Lungs were rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen and fixed in Carnoy's solution. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron. At the time of the LR (382 +/- 39 min after OA challenge). RL increased from the baseline value (0.067 +/- 0.034 cm H2O.ml-1.s) by 0.107 +/- 0.03 cm H2O.ml-1.s (p less than 0.05). RL did not change significantly in the control rats. The lumen size and the wall area of all membranous airways were measured and were corrected for airway size by dividing by the basement membrane length squared (BM2). There was no increase in airway wall area in OA-challenged animals. However. the lumen of large airways (BM: 2.0 to 2.99 mm) was significantly less for the OA-challenged animals (0.039 +/- 0.0055 mm2) than for the control animals (0.058 +/- 0.0063 mm2; p less than 0.05). In six additional rats. the distribution of mast cells (MC) in the bronchial tree was determined. Tissues were fixed with Carnoy's solution and stained with a modified May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain. There were significantly more MC in the large airways than in medial or small airways. We conclude that smooth muscle constriction of large airways and not airway wall edema accounts for the LR in the rat. The distribution of the mast cells corresponds closely to the site of bronchoconstriction.\",\n",
       " '20, Quantitative structural analysis of peripheral airways and arteries in sudden fatal asthma, The peripheral airways and the adjacent muscular pulmonary arteries were studied by morphometric methods in the autopsy lungs of six asthmatic subjects who died suddenly during an asthma attack. and they were compared with those of six control subjects who died of other causes and had no history of respiratory diseases. Bronchioles of asthmatic subjects had an increased amount of lumen occlusion (p less than 0.01). smooth muscle thickness (p less than 0.001). and inflammatory infiltrate (p less than 0.001). and both mononuclear cells and eosinophils contributed to this increased inflammation. The muscular pulmonary arteries adjacent to occluded and inflamed bronchioles did not have the morphologic features of chronic hypoxia. as shown by the normal medial and intimal thickness. but they had an important inflammatory process in their walls that was particularly marked at sites adjacent to airways. Although the functional significance of these findings is unknown. they may be responsible in part for the gas exchange abnormalities observed in acute severe asthma.',\n",
       " \"23, Bronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis associated with smoking. A morphologic cross-sectional population analysis, The lungs of 42 smokers and 13 nonsmoking males of various ages who died suddenly and unexpectedly were examined grossly using Gough-Wentworth whole-lung sections and by microscopic planimetry to assess the severity and prevalence of emphysema. The bronchioles in representative histologic sections were evaluated for inflammation and epithelial metaplasia as well as for fibrosis and muscular hypertrophy. Postmortem interviews with next of kin established a history of cigarette smoking and excluded possible occupational exposures to toxic or particulate inhalants. Emphysematous changes were not prominent in members of the study group. but they tended to be more severe in smokers (p = 0.059) and increased in severity with age (p less than 0.001). Inflammatory changes (so-called smoker's bronchiolitis) were evident in smokers of all ages. although they were significantly less prominent in the lungs of older smokers. On the other hand. respiratory and membranous bronchiolar wall fibrosis was increasingly evident in older smokers (p less than 0.05). Muscular hypertrophy in the bronchiolar walls was significantly greater in smokers. but a change with age was not observed. These findings strongly suggest that bronchiolar fibrosis is associated with chronic cigarette use. These lesions occur independently of emphysema and may account for some of the subtle physiologic alterations observed in smokers.\",\n",
       " '14, A positron emission tomographic comparison of pulmonary vascular permeability during the adult respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia, We measured extravascular density (EVD) and the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER) for 68Ga-transferrin using positron emission tomography in 14 normal volunteers and 29 patients with radiographic infiltrates. including six patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). eight patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). and 15 patients with focal pneumonia. Contralateral. radiographically normal regions were also evaluated in the patients with focal pneumonia. Mean EVD was elevated in the patients with CHF. ARDS. and pneumonia in regions of radiographic infiltrate compared with values from normal subjects (p less than 0.05). but it was not significantly different among the three patient groups. PTCER in normal subjects and in patients with CHF was not significantly different (21 +/- 11 versus 44 +/- 16 x 10(-4) min-1. respectively. p = NS). PTCER was elevated in regions of infiltrate because of either pneumonia (173 +/- 99) or ARDS (170 +/- 79). PTCER was also elevated in regions contralateral to those with focal infiltrate during pneumonia. even though these regions were radiographically normal and had normal EVD values. These results suggest that PTCER is a sensitive but nonspecific index of abnormal pulmonary vascular permeability. which may be useful for classifying patients in clinical studies of pulmonary edema.',\n",
       " '1, Sepsis-induced lung injury and the effects of ibuprofen pretreatment. Analysis of early alveolar events via repetitive bronchoalveolar lavage, Current knowledge of alveolar pathophysiology during early sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the role of resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in mediating alveolar inflammatory events during sepsis is limited. Further. the effects of ibuprofen pretreatment upon alveolar pathophysiology and AM function during early sepsis-induced ALI is unclear. Utilizing repetitive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in a porcine model of sepsis-induced ALI. we studied changes in alveolar cellular constituents. BAL protein content and molecular composition. and AM superoxide anion (O2-.) generation during early sepsis. The neutrophil percentage of recovered alveolar cells (17 +/- 8%. t = 300 min versus 2 +/- 1%. t = 0; p = 0.06) and the bronchoalveolar lavage total protein content (493 +/- 110 micrograms/ml. t = 300 min versus 109 +/- 18 micrograms/ml. t = 0; p less than 0.05) increased in septic animals. Increases in BAL fluid total protein were primarily due to low-molecular-weight plasma protein. indicating relative preservation of alveolar-capillary membrane size selectivity. Alveolar macrophages harvested following 300 min of sepsis generated significantly less O2-. following phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation compared to AM harvested at baseline. Ibuprofen pretreatment of septic animals completely blocked leakage of plasma proteins into the alveoli and attenuated neutrophil migration but did not prevent downregulation of AM O2-. generation. Increased alveolar-capillary membrane permeability. neutrophil migration into the alveoli. and downregulation of AM oxidant generation occur within hours of the onset of sepsis. Ibuprofen pretreatment significantly attenuates early sepsis-induced ALI without altering sepsis-induced AM dysfunction.',\n",
       " '23, Diaphragmatic fatigue produced by constant or modulated electric currents, In anesthetized rabbits the efficiency of phrenic nerve stimulation with trains of electric current was studied either when ventilation was effected entirely by bilateral nerve stimulation (electrophrenic ventilation) or during unilateral nerve stimulation when animals were ventilated with a pump and open chest. Trains of rectangular electric pulses (RPT) with constant amplitude and frequency or sine waves. both the amplitude and frequency of which were modulated and controlled by a computer (MSWT). were used with each animal. MSWT closely reproduced the physiological shape of transdiaphragmatic pressure waves. Diaphragm fatigue. as determined from the decrease in the maximal relaxation rate of twitches. occurred after 20 minutes of bilateral or unilateral nerve stimulation with RPT. but only after 60 min (unilateral stimulation) or 98 min (bilateral stimulation) with MSWT. These data show the importance of the motor signal pattern in long-lasting nerve stimulation.',\n",

Lung and skin biopsies revealed a sterile infiltration of the interstitial tissues by mature neutrophils. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in rapid clinical improvement; however. recurrent episodes were increasingly resistant to therapy. and she ultimately died from respiratory failure. Sweet's syndrome involving the lung is rare. with only two previously reported cases documented by lung biopsy. Prompt recognition of Sweet's syndrome with lung involvement is important because of the potential for severe respiratory compromise.\",\n",

Assessments of airway responsiveness to methacholine during therapy revealed airway hyperreactivity that reverted to normal when the methotrexate was stopped. An extension of the methotrexate dosage interval from 7 to 10 days resulted in an abolition of the asthma. which remained in remission despite a return to a weekly cycle after a 3-month period of 10-day cycles.',\n",

There were two vertebral arteriovenous fistulas. one peroneal arteriovenous fistula. and one radial arteriovenous fistula. The first two fistulas were spontaneous. the other two were traumatic. The only partial occlusion of the peroneal fistula was. in our opinion. due to a technical failure. the balloon was inflated slightly proximal to the fistular orificium instead of in the orificium itself. There were no complications. and there was no morbidity. In our opinion transvascular balloon embolization technique is the treatment of choice for solitary arteriovenous fistulas.',\n",
       " '4, A new method for mapping hepatic subsegment: counterstaining identification technique, Hepatic subsegmentectomy requires identification of the borders of tumor-bearing subsegment. usually achieved by injecting dye into the portal veins feeding the domain. We describe an alternative technique for performing systematic subsegmentectomy in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. in whom hepatic arterial and portal venous embolizations were already performed as a preoperative adjuvant. Under ultrasonic guidance. each of the neighboring portal units is sequentially stained. thus defining the avascular subsegment to be resected as the nonstaining area. This allows the subsegment to be totally resected. This counterstaining identification technique can be used for all subsegments undergoing complete embolization and for other situations in which the usual staining method is impossible because of the presence of arterioportal shunting or portal tumor thrombus.',\n",
       " \"20, Perception of breathlessness during bronchoconstriction induced by antigen, exercise, and histamine challenges, Perception of breathlessness was studied in eight patients with mild. stable asthma after a histamine and exercise challenge performed before and 24 and 48 hours respectively after an antigen challenge. FEV1 and perception of breathlessness. evaluated by Borg's 10 point category scale. were measured after each administration of doubling antigen or histamine concentrations to achieve a greater than 20% fall in FEV1. and after six minutes of steady state exercise at 80% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). The geometric mean provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) fell from 1.67 mg/ml before antigen challenge to 0.52 mg/ml 24 hours after the challenge. The median maximal % fall in FEV1 with exercise was 24.9% (range 10.5-40.5%) before and 30.6% (range 13.8-52.3%) 48 hours after antigen challenge. The median maximum % fall in FEV1 after antigen inhalation was 20.1% (range 13.3-35.2%) within the first hour; only two subjects had a late fall in FEV1 (23% and 58%). The median (range) of Borg scores obtained when FEV1 was reduced by 20% did not differ significantly for the three types of acute challenges: 1.25 (0.5-2.5) and 1.0 (0.5-3.0) after histamine tests. 1.0 (0.5-4.1) and 1.55 (0.5-2.0) after exercise. and 1.5 (0-3.0) after antigen challenge. In the two subjects who had a late response to antigen the Borg score was reduced for the same % fall in FEV1 as with the early response. It is concluded that the perception of breathlessness does not differ appreciably during the early response to histamine. antigen exposure. or exercise. but that it is reduced during the late asthmatic response. It was not influenced by previous antigen exposure. despite an increase in airway responsiveness.\",\n",

They represent different generations. ages. stages. and severities of the disease. All were assumed to have the same metabolic defect. The disease is a multisystem disorder with a metabolic defect located at complex 1 in the respiratory chain. Clinically. the disorder gives symptoms such as hearing loss. retinal pigmental degeneration. ataxia. cardiomyopathy. muscular fatiguability and neuropathy. The patients were investigated with nerve conduction studies. concentric needle EMG. SFEMG. and macro EMG examinations. Neurophysiologic studies revealed signs of myopathy in both the younger members and in those with slight muscular symptoms. In the more advanced stages. neuropathic changes of the axonal type were seen as well. Macro EMG was interpreted as indicating muscle fiber membrane abnormalities in the early stages. Single fiber EMG studies indicate that this metabolic defect does not disturb neuromuscular transmission.',\n",
       " '20, Analysis of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies, The measurement of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies has the advantage of quantifying an objective physiological feature of asthma. Bronchial reactivity was developed in a clinical setting and has been conventionally expressed as the dose of agonist producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20). As PD20 can be estimated for less than 20% of subjects in general community surveys with the doses of agonist that are usually given. data from most subjects must be censored. Thus PD20 alone is a poor index of bronchial reactivity for epidemiological studies. Data from 809 aluminium smelter workers were used to evaluate alternative methods of analysing bronchial reactivity. Dose-response relationships were analysed by four methods: (1) PD20 by the conventional method of interpolating the dose on a logarithmic scale between the last two measurements of FEV1; (2) PD20 (with allowance for extrapolation). estimated by fitting an exponential curve to the dose-response data; (3) the linear regression slope between dose and FEV1 when significant; (4) the dose-response slope obtained in all subjects as the % change in FEV1 from baseline in response to total dose. When each of these measures was related to symptoms. diagnosis. and treatment of asthma. all differentiated between \"asthmatic\" and \"non-asthmatic\" subjects. The dose-response slope (method 4) had the advantages of simplicity and no censored data. and was shown to be clinically relevant. It is suggested that the dose-response slope should be used for the analysis of bronchial reactivity in epidemiological studies.',\n",

The micronised gentamicin powder preparation caused cough in half the patients but this did not stop their receiving a full dose. Dry powder gentamicin may be a convenient formulation for long term inhaled treatment if the problem of cough can be overcome.',\n",

Also studied were 38 age matched children who had had hyaline membrane disease but had not required ventilation. 25 unmatched children who were born prematurely but did not develop hyaline membrane disease. and 39 randomly selected pupils of similar age. There was no difference in thoracic gas volume. total lung capacity. inspiratory vital capacity. residual volume. or transfer factor for carbon monoxide between the groups. Respiratory symptoms during the three years before the study and the frequency of clinically diagnosed asthma in patients and their family were similar in all the children with hyaline membrane disease irrespective of whether they had been ventilated or had had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. however. had a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before bronchodilator (73% predicted) than the other groups (88-95% predicted). Children who had required ventilation had lower values for specific airways conductance (sGaw) and a greater increase in FEV1 (delta FEV1) after salbutamol (13%) than non-ventilated children (6%); delta FEV1 was associated with the peak pressure of intermittent positive pressure ventilation. a family history of asthma and a history of wheezing. recurrent respiratory illnesses. and a doctor's diagnosis of asthma during the three years before the study. These findings indicate that after eight years of age patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have more reversible airways obstruction. compatible with increased bronchial smooth muscle tone.\",\n",
       " '22, X-irradiation improves mdx mouse muscle as a model of myofiber loss in DMD, The mdx mouse. although a genetic and biochemical homologue of human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). presents a comparatively mild histopathological and clinical phenotype. These differences are partially attributable to the greater efficacy of regeneration in the mdx mouse than in DMD muscle. To lessen this disparity. we have used a single dose of X-irradiation (16 Gy) to inhibit regeneration in one leg of mdx mice. The result is an almost complete block of muscle fiber regeneration leading to progressive loss of muscle fibers and their replacement by loose connective tissue. Surviving fibers are mainly peripherally nucleated and. surprisingly. of large diameter. Thus. X-irradiation converts mdx muscle to a model system in which the degenerative process can be studied in isolation from the complicating effect of myofiber regeneration. This system should be of use for testing methods of alleviating the myofiber degeneration which is common to mdx and DMD.',\n",

SNCVs. and SEP latencies following stimulation of lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. To determine the relevance for diagnosis of these tests and side-to-side comparison. the results were compared in patients with unilateral meralgia paresthetica and normal subjects. The long-term outcome was also considered. in order to determine whether electrophysiologic findings contribute to the prognosis. In our study. SNAP amplitude comparison was found to be more useful for diagnosis than SNCV and SEP latency comparisons. However the value of the SNAP amplitude on the affected side. just as the results of the other tests. was not found to be predictive of the outcome. Also the results of the tests depend on the methods used and on the nerve's route.\",\n",

All patients had undergone coronary catheterization and were initially treated medically. Follow-up study was performed at a median of 51 months. Separate logistic regression models. which had been previously developed to predict 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD). were compared using a Cox regression analysis to predict time to a subsequent cardiac event. The exercise electrocardiography model. consisting of the magnitude of ST depression. exercise heart rate and patient gender. was a powerful predictor (chi-square = 30.8. p less than 0.0001) of subsequent events. The exercise radionuclide angiography model. which included the exercise response of the pressure-volume ratio in addition to the exercise electrocardiography variables. had similar prognostic power (chi-square = 31.8. p less than 0.0001). In a separate analysis considering only cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. the exercise electrocardiography model remained a significant predictor of events (chi-square = 12.2. p less than 0.001). None of the radionuclide angiography variables added significantly to the prognostic power of the exercise electrocardiography model. Thus. in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram who are not taking digoxin. the supine exercise electrocardiography model that predicts 3-vessel or left main CAD also predicts future cardiac events. Exercise radionuclide angiography does not provide any additional prognostic information in such patients.',\n",

This abnormality was more marked in patients with active/very active disease. Absolute number of CD4+ CD29+ cells was negatively correlated with spontaneous anti-DNA Ig production that we demonstrated to be a laboratory index strongly correlated with a clinical disease activity score.

Antihistamine pretreatment ablates the histamine but not the effect of thermal injury or bradykinin. Bradykinin is generated via activation of Hageman factor in a two-step reaction. Steps 1 and 2 can be inhibited by corn trypsin inhibitor and soy bean trypsin inhibitors. respectively. Dye-release lesions were reduced from thermal injury and bradykinin injections when these substances were injected into the skin first. Angiotensin-converting enzyme deactivates bradykinin by degrading it. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor neutralizes angiotensin-converting enzyme. Dye-release lesions from both thermal injury and bradykinin injection were enhanced because of continued bradykinin build-up when these treatments were preceded by subcutaneous injections of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus bradykinin is generated in thermal injury via the Hageman factor-dependent pathway. Hageman factor sits at the apex of a series of interrelated cascade systems. all of which impinge on the animal\\'s immune status. Uncontrolled Hagemen factor activation in thermal injury may be the link among all the events collectively known as the \"post thermal injury immunosuppression syndrome.\".',\n",
       " \"21, The 1990 Everett Idris Evans memorial lecture: the inhalation injury, The most important question that had to be answered from our animal data was whether a significant difference existed between the two groups. It could be observed that the resuscitation with Ringer's lactate did not lead to any increased lymph flow or total transcapillary protein flow in spite of the drop in protein and oncotic pressure in plasma. With Ringer's lactate there was a lower lymph to plasma protein ratio. which might be significant. No negative difference could be observed either in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or pulmonary vessel resistance. All animals survived throughout the experiment. and in all experiments no advantages regarding the vital parameters could be ascertained with the administration of albumin; however. several factors must be borne in mind. The inhalation injury was from a heat source alone and no toxic substances were involved. Only inhalation trauma was induced in the absence of a surface burn wound. The duration of the observation was for only 36 hours. Thus some caution must be observed in applying these findings to a clinical situation. In our evaluation of the clinical results. we have seen that no differences could be established in regard to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and extravascular lung water between the Ringer's lactate and the albumin group. In spite of a 50% drop in oncotic pressure. however. this is only valid for the first 24 to 36 hours. after which one could assume that a further protein drop coupled with a still raised hydrostatic filtration coefficient would lead to interstitial edema.\",\n",

Wheezing occurred during 76 (66%) of the 115 episodes and during a third of these the patient was admitted to hospital because of severe dyspnoea. Wheezing started a mean (SD) of 43 (7) hours after the first symptoms of respiratory infection and persisted for 3.8 (4.2) days in patients in whom virus infection was diagnosed. The incidence of wheezing was not associated with IgE mediated atopy. with positive virological tests. or with fever during virus infection. but was associated with parental smoking and more than one sibling.',\n",
       " '23, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in infantile cholestasis, The difficulty of distinguishing surgically correctable causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in infants from other causes means that some infants may undergo laparotomy and intraoperative cholangiography unnecessarily. and others may be referred for surgery too late. In an attempt to improve the diagnostic accuracy in infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when standard methods produced equivocal results. we have been using prototype paediatric duodenoscopes (PJF 7.5 and XPJF 8.0; Olympus) to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). From 159 infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. 11 were referred for ERCP. which was performed in nine. In four in whom bile ducts were definitely visualised laparotomy was avoided. Operative cholangiography confirmed patent bile ducts in one in whom visualisation had been uncertain. Three of four in whom bile ducts were not seen had extrahepatic biliary atresia. Visible bile drainage in the fourth excluded atresia. No major complications ensued but there was radiological evidence of gall bladder perforation in one (common hepatic duct block) and overinflation with air was a problem until finer cannulae (Wilson-Cook) were introduced. In appropriately selected patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. ERCP with paediatric duodenoscopes in experienced hands may provide useful diagnostic information.',\n",
       " '23, Physical and psychosocial consequences of total laryngectomy, The incidence and severity of respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy and their influence on daily living were studied in 59 laryngectomized patients. Daily sputum production was the principal complaint of these patients (98%). followed by coughing (64%) and the need for frequent forced expectoration (more than 5 times a day) in order to clear the airway (57%). Frequent stoma cleaning (more than 5 times a day) was required by 37% of the patients. Significant correlation was found between respiratory symptoms. voice rehabilitation and several aspects of daily living. including fatigue. sleep problems. social contacts and psychological distress. These findings indicate that respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy are both frequent and troublesome. The development of effective methods for minimizing and/or preventing such respiratory problems would contribute significantly to improving the quality of life of laryngectomized patients.',\n",
       " '23, External ear resonance in children with otitis media with effusion, A middle ear effusion has been shown. in KEMAR. to increase the height of the resonant peak of the external auditory canal by 6 dB SPL. It has also been shown that the hearing impairment due to otitis media with effusion is related to the volume of middle ear fluid. Therefore. it was hypothesized that measurement of the height of the resonant peak of the external auditory canal could be used as a method of assessing the magnitude of any hearing impairment due to otitis media with effusion. 182 ears from 182 children aged 3-12 (mean 6.3) years were studied. Pure-tone audiometry and impedance tympanometry were performed. and the acoustics of the external auditory canal were measured using the Rastronics CC1-10 frequency response analyser. The mean height of the resonant peak (17.9 dB SPL) of children with a type A tympanogram was significantly different from the mean value (23.6 dB SPL) of those with a type B tympanogram. There was a significant correlation between the height of the resonant peak and the speech frequency average of the pure-tone thresholds. The sensitivity and specificity of using the height of the resonant peak to detect hearing impairments in different age groups were calculated and compared with the sensitivity and specificity of tympanometry. The test did not provide the same degree of sensitivity as tympanometry but was more specific. The additional advantages of the test are that it is quick. taking less than 1 min per ear. and is well tolerated by children in whom there was a 99% compliance.',\n",
       " '15, Iron deficiency anemia in the elderly: the diagnostic process, OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of physician probability estimates calculated on the basis of findings from history-taking and physical examination in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in elderly patients. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Two community hospitals offering secondary and tertiary care. PATIENTS: A total of 259 patients over 65 years of age found to have previously undiagnosed anemia. MEASURES: Physician estimates of the likelihood of iron deficiency before (pretest probability) and after (post-test probability) the laboratory test results were available. The hemogram was available to the physicians when they made their pretest probability estimates. Because the serum ferritin level proved to be the most powerful of the laboratory test results studied. the likelihood ratios associated with the post-test estimates were compared with the ratios associated with the serum ferritin level. MAIN RESULTS: The post-test probability estimates were influenced by the serum ferritin level and the pretest estimates. The post-test estimates derived from the findings obtained through history-taking and physical examination and the laboratory test results (including the serum ferritin level) were slightly less accurate in predicting iron deficiency than the serum ferritin level alone. Nevertheless. a model in which the pretest estimates were used in addition to the serum ferritin level to predict iron deficiency proved to be more powerful than the serum ferritin level alone (p = 0.006). This indicated that the limitations of the post-test estimates were due to a misinterpretation of the serum ferritin level and that the findings from history-taking and physical examination added important diagnostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians must be aware of test properties to provide optimal care to their patients. If test results are properly interpreted. pretest probabilities derived from findings obtained through history-taking and physical examination can add useful information that will lead to more accurate diagnoses.',\n",

Of these. 24 units (36%) had obstructive (group I) and 42 (64%) non-obstructive hydronephrosis (group II). Significantly compromised renal function was found only in group I. Treatment in group I was by an early pyeloplasty; in group II the patients were kept under close review. During the 6-year period. 2 units (5%) in group II. deteriorated. 13 (31%) improved and 27 (64%) were unchanged. These results suggest that early in life. antenatally diagnosed PUJ hydronephrosis without obstruction may be a relatively benign condition but will require long-term follow-up in order to determine the natural history of the condition.',\n",

There is a recognized error in palpation. not only for detecting the presence of tumour but also its size. This study used an animal tumour model system to compare the ability of 6 independent observers of varying experience to detect and stage superficially transplanted growths. A preclinical medical student was as good as a Consultant ENT Surgeon in predicting the presence of tumour but the ability to stage tumours accurately was related to experience. Whilst the most experienced observers accurately estimated the size of tumours less than 2 cm. they were less accurate for larger (greater than 2 cm) tumours which were constantly understaged. This phenomenon may have important clinical implications particularly related to current nodal staging criteria.',\n",

       " '4, Venous and arterial thrombosis in patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, The records of 2.673 patients randomized according to seven consecutive Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) studies of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer were reviewed for the occurrence of vascular complications. All protocols opened and closed between June 1977 and July 1987. The objectives of the present study were (1) to compare the frequency of vascular complications among patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer with patients on observation. and (2) to estimate the contribution of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy to the occurrence of venous and arterial thrombi. The frequency of thrombosis. both venous and arterial combined. was 5.4% among patients who received adjuvant therapy and was 1.6% among patients on observation (P = .0002). Premenopausal patients who received chemotherapy and tamoxifen had significantly more venous complications than those who received chemotherapy without tamoxifen (2.8% v 0.8%. P = .03). Postmenopausal patients who received tamoxifen and chemotherapy had significantly more venous thrombi than those who received tamoxifen alone (8.0% v 2.3%. P = .03) or those who were observed (8.0% v 0.4%. P less than .0001). Premenopausal patients who received tamoxifen and chemotherapy had a 1.6% frequency of arterial thrombosis. significantly more than patients who received chemotherapy alone (1.6% v 0.0%. P = .004). The frequency of arterial thrombosis among postmenopausal patients was not significantly correlated with adjuvant therapy. In conclusion. patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer had a 5.4% frequency of thromboembolic complications. significantly more than those who were observed. The combination of chemotherapy and tamoxifen was associated with more venous and arterial thromboembolic complications than chemotherapy alone in premenopausal patients and with more venous thrombi than tamoxifen alone among postmenopausal patients.',\n",

Forty-five patients had limited disease (LD) and 25 extensive disease (ED) with good prognostic features. The regimen consisted of cisplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1 and etoposide 75 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 2. alternating weekly with ifosfamide 2 g/m2 IV day 8 and doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 IV day 8. for a total of 12 weeks. Dose modifications were made according to defined hematologic criteria. Responding patients with limited disease subsequently received mediastinal radiotherapy. Overall response to chemotherapy was 91% with a complete response (CR) rate of 50%. Forty-five patients with limited disease (LD) achieved an overall response rate of 91% with a CR rate of 51%. and 25 patients with extensive disease (ED) achieved an overall response rate of 92% with a CR rate of 48%. Median survival for the whole group was 54 weeks (LD. 58 weeks; ED. 42 weeks). Hematologic toxicity was predictable. without the wide fluctuations in WBC count seen in conventional 3-weekly regimens. In all. one quarter of treatment courses were delayed. most frequently because of leukopenia. Dose reductions were required in 63% of cases. The average delivered dose intensity was calculated and shown to be 73% of projected. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild with nausea and vomiting being the most common. This weekly schedule of chemotherapy has proved to be active and well tolerated and is currently being compared with conventional 3-weekly chemotherapy in a randomized study.',\n",
       " '15, Hepatopathy-thrombocytopenia syndrome--a complication of dactinomycin therapy for Wilms\\' tumor: a report from the United Kingdom Childrens Cancer Study Group, We have observed hepatopathy. associated with thrombocytopenia. in children receiving chemotherapy for Wilms\\' tumor. We have studied this hepatopathy-thrombocytopenia syndrome (HTS) in patients enrolled in the United Kingdom Childrens\\' Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Wilms\\' tumor trials (UKW1 and UKW2). At the time of this study. 501 patients had completed therapy. Treatment flow sheets were examined for evidence of hepatopathy (hepatomegaly with abnormal liver function tests) and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 25 x 10(9)/L). No child who developed the syndrome had received irradiation. HTS was seen in five of 355 (1.4%) of patients treated with combination chemotherapy but in none of the 146 patients treated with vincristine alone. In each instance. the onset was less than 10 weeks after diagnosis. In two children. hepatopathy was severe with jaundice. ascites. transaminases greater than 1.000 IU/L. and prolongation of prothrombin time. On average. HTS lasted 12 days. and resolved with supportive treatment. After recovery. the children tolerated chemotherapy. mostly at reduced dosage. without recurrence. There was no evident long-term morbidity. Dactinomycin is the probable cause of this syndrome. We conclude that the HTS is a rare but important complication of dactinomycin-containing combination chemotherapy for Wilms\\' tumor. Children developing \"isolated\" thrombocytopenia following dactinomycin are \"at risk\" of developing the full-blown syndrome and should have their treatment modified accordingly.',\n",
       " '4, Influence of chemotherapy administration on monocyte activation by liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine in children with osteosarcoma, The purpose of these studies was to determine whether chemotherapy interfered with the ability of peripheral blood monocytes from patients with osteosarcoma to respond to the liposome-encapsulated activating agent muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (L-MTP-PE). This was done in preparation of designing an adjuvant therapy protocol that includes L-MTP-PE combined with chemotherapy postoperatively for the treatment of primary osteosarcoma. The majority of patients who fail current adjuvant chemotherapy do so while on chemotherapy. Therefore. we believe it is important to combine L-MTP-PE with chemotherapy early in the treatment course rather than waiting until all chemotherapy cycles are completed. The tumoricidal properties of monocytes from patients with osteosarcoma could be activated by L-MTP-PE to levels equal to or greater than those expressed by normal control monocytes. No intrinsic monocyte defect could be demonstrated. Single-agent chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin (CPD). high-dose methotrexate (MTX). Cytoxan (CTX. cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Co. Evansville. IN). or Adriamycin (ADR. doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories. Columbus. OH) did not interfere with this activation process. There was even a suggestion of enhanced activation potential following the administration of ADR. However. when both ADR and CTX were administered together on the same day. profound suppression in monocyte activation was observed. This suppressed function returned to normal by 3 weeks postcombination therapy. We therefore conclude that L-MTP-PE can be combined with ADR. CPD. MTX. or CTX as single agents but recommend that ADR plus L-MTP-PE is the most effective combination. By contrast. we discourage the use of L-MTP-PE when ADR and CTX are given together.',\n",
       " '12, Sex or survival: trade-offs between quality and quantity of life, Patients with localized prostate cancer may be treated with either surgery (radical prostatectomy) or radiotherapy. Although controversial. many physicians believe that surgery offers a higher survival rate. However. the surgical treatment may also produce a higher rate of sexual impotency. Our study assessed how men value survival and sexual potency when asked to trade off one for the other. Using the treatment-choice technique. we interviewed 50 men aged 45 to 70 years without known prostate cancer. At hypothetical rates of survival (90% at 5 years for surgery) and impotency (90% for surgery and 40% for radiotherapy) representing published estimates. 32% of respondents were unwilling to trade off any survival. but 68% were willing to trade off a 10% or greater advantage in 5-year survival (by choosing radiotherapy) to maintain sexual potency. The median 5-year survival traded off was 10% (range. 0% to 80%). Willingness to trade off survival for sexual potency was significantly related to level of education. but not to age. interest in sex. frequency of sexual intercourse. or ability to achieve erection. We conclude that some men may choose treatment with lower long-term survival to increase their chance of remaining sexually potent. Because these men may be difficult to identify in clinical practice. physicians should thoroughly discuss both surgery and radiotherapy options with patients who have localized prostate cancer.',\n",
       " '4, Intrapleural cisplatin and cytarabine in the management of malignant pleural effusions: a Lung Cancer Study Group trial, Malignant pleural effusions are a common and significant problem in patients with advanced malignancies. Pleurodesis with tetracycline or other sclerosing agents is the usual treatment for malignant pleural effusions. In contrast to this approach. intrapleural chemotherapy has the potential advantage of treating the underlying malignancy in addition to controlling the effusion. Intracavitary cisplatin-based chemotherapy. which is cytotoxic rather than sclerosing. has proven safe and effective via the intraperitoneal route in ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma. There has been little previous experience. however. with intrapleural cisplatin-based chemotherapy. As part of a planned series of trials in malignant mesothelioma. the Lung Cancer Study Group first evaluated intrapleural cisplatin and cytarabine in patients with malignant pleural effusions from a variety of solid tumors. From April 1986 to November 1987. 46 patients with cytologically proven. symptomatic. and previously untreated malignant pleural effusions were entered on study. A single dose of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus cytarabine 1.200 mg was instilled into the pleural space via a chest tube. which was then immediately removed. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response at 24 hours; 1. 2. and 3 weeks; and then monthly. No recurrence of the effusion was considered a complete response (CR). Partial response (PR) was defined as a 75% or greater decrease in the amount of the effusion on serial chest radiographs. One patient experienced reversible grade 4 renal toxicity. four patients had grade 3 hematologic toxicity. and five patients had grade 3 cardiopulmonary toxicity. The overall response rate (CR plus PR) at 3 weeks was 49% (18 of 37 patients). The median length of response was 9 months for a CR and 5.1 months for a PR. The outcome of this trial was sufficiently encouraging that this regimen has been incorporated into subsequent trials for malignant pleural mesothelioma.',\n",

The French Epirubicin Study Group, The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2. cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2. and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2. cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2. and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients. Patients were stratified according to whether or not there were bone metastases only. Four hundred twelve patients entered this trial; 378 were assessable for tolerability and 365 for efficacy. The overall response rates were comparable between FEC 50 (44.6%) and FEC 75 (44.7%). but both were better than the epirubicin alone (30.6%) (P = .04 and P = .0006. respectively). The complete response rate was better in FEC 75 (15.5%) than in FEC 50 (7%) (P = .025) or epirubicin (4%) (P = .002). Similar results were obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups. being 412 days. 440 days. and 350 days for FEC 50. FEC 75. and epirubicin. respectively. Patients without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. Overall. the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other groups. which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival were not different among the three groups. but more early relapses occurred in the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 8 months in the FEC 75 group. and the survival difference between the epirubicin group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance. No difference in survival was observed between epirubicin- and FEC 50-group patients. even though the response rate was significantly worse in the monochemotherapy group.',\n",

The intended treatment consisted of 16 courses of LEP or eight courses of HEP given at 3-weekly intervals. Reasons for stopping treatment early included progressive disease. stable disease without symptomatic improvement. or severe toxicity deemed intolerable by either the patient or physician. Toxicity was recorded at 3-weekly and response at 9-weekly intervals using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of response and toxicity. Two hundred nine patients were eligible for analysis. 98% of whom have been followed for more than a year. One hundred four patients received LEP and 105 HEP. Significantly worse myelosuppression. alopecia. nausea and vomiting. and mucositis were seen in the high-dose arm (P less than or equal to .001). More patients in the LEP arm stopped treatment before the fourth course than in the HEP arm. and the commonest reason for stopping was progressive disease. A similar median number of courses was given in each arm. There was a significantly higher response in the HEP arm (HEP - complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] = 41%. LEP - CR + PR = 23%). Despite this. no statistically significant differences was seen in overall survival or progression-free interval. The median survival for HEP and LEP was 44 and 46 weeks. respectively.',\n",
       " '20, The role of dose intensity in determining outcome in intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, To determine whether the dose intensity of chemotherapeutic regimens correlates with the complete remission rate in adult patients with advanced-stage intermediate-grade lymphoma. reports of comparative trials of therapy were reviewed. Reports were identified using MEDLINE. through references from review articles. and through review of selected abstracts. Twenty-two studies including 14 randomized and eight cohort trials were analyzed to assess projected dose intensity. Four other studies were analyzed to assess the role of received dose intensity. Dose intensities were calculated using described methods and correlated with complete remission rates. Individual trials were assessed using \"levels of evidence.\" A metaanalysis of randomized trials and a cross-trial analysis of all comparative trials using a weighted least squares linear regression were performed. Using levels of evidence. support was obtained for the hypothesis that dose intensity correlates with the remission rate from two trials in which dose intensity was \"indirectly\" tested. As these studies did not \"directly\" test dose intensity. confounding variables. including those arising from the assumptions made in calculating dose intensity. cannot be excluded. Metaanalysis showed a relative probability of achieving complete remission of 1.34 (95% confidence interval. 1.13 to 1.58) favoring the pooled arm of high dose intensity. Cross-trial analysis showed a relatively weak association between dose intensity and remission rate (r = .49. P = .0001). Two of four reports retrospectively assessing received dose intensity suggested that increased dose intensity is associated with superior remission rates. These analyses suggest that dose intensity may correlate with the remission rate in advanced-stage intermediate-grade lymphoma. However. properly designed trials directly testing dose intensity have not been performed and are needed to confirm this hypothesis.',\n",

In the present study. the effects of the toxin were examined on endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations of hypercholesterolemic and atherosclerotic porcine coronary arteries to assess the functional state of the endothelial pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Male Yorkshire pigs were maintained on either a regular diet (control group. n = 7) or a 2% high-cholesterol diet (cholesterol-fed group. n = 7) for 10 weeks. After the initial 2 weeks of maintenance. animals in both groups underwent balloon catheter removal of the endothelium of the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary arteries. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro after 10 weeks of maintenance; at this time. a full lining of endothelial cells in both left coronary arteries was confirmed histologically. In arteries with endothelium of the control group (normal responses). pertussis toxin significantly inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxations to serotonin. UK14304 (a selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist). and thrombin but not those to ADP. bradykinin. or the calcium ionophore A23187. In previously denuded arteries of the control group (effects of endothelial regeneration alone) or intact arteries of the cholesterol-fed group (effects of hypercholesterolemia alone). the relaxations to serotonin. UK14304. and thrombin were impaired significantly; those relaxations were impaired further in previously denuded arteries of the cholesterol-fed group (effects of atherosclerosis). The inhibitory effects of pertussis toxin were significantly reduced after endothelial regeneration and in hypercholesterolemia and were almost absent in atherosclerosis.',\n",
       " '14, Load dependence of left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relations during short-term coronary artery occlusion, We evaluated the effect of altered loading conditions on left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure-volume relations during acute coronary artery occlusion that was produced by inflation of an intracoronary balloon. Open-chest anesthetized dogs (n = 18) were instrumented so that LV pressure (micromanometer) and LV volume (conductance) could be measured without disturbing the pericardium. The effects of brief periods of occlusion (1-2 minutes) were assessed under steady-state conditions before and after dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent and during vena caval occlusion. Under steady-state conditions before dextran infusion with the pericardium removed. at an LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP) of 8.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg. occlusion resulted in a rightward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop (delta LVEDP. 2.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg; delta LVEDV. 6.3 +/- 4.7 ml. both p less than 0.05 versus control). After dextran infusion (LVEDP. 20.9 +/- 6.0 mm Hg). occlusion resulted in a rightward and upward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop (delta LVEDP. 5.8 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; delta LVEDV. 4.2 +/- 3.0 ml. both p less than 0.05 versus control). At low cardiac volumes before dextran infusion. the intact pericardium did not affect the response to occlusion. By contrast. after dextran infusion in the presence of an intact pericardium. LVEDP significantly increased (delta. 6.4 +/- 3.6 mm Hg. p less than 0.05) but LVDEV did not (delta. 0.7 +/- 1.5 ml. p = NS). There was a parallel upward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop that was eliminated by removal of the pericardium. Thus. the change in LV diastolic pressure and volume during occlusion varied and depended on the baseline cardiac volume and presence of the pericardium. Before dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent. coronary artery occlusion did not alter the LV diastolic chamber stiffness parameter. which was calculated from the diastolic interval of an averaged steady-state beat (0.040 +/- 0.019 versus 0.036 +/- 0.015 mm Hg/ml. p = NS). After dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent. coronary artery occlusion increased the LV diastolic chamber stiffness parameter (0.057 +/- 0.034 and 0.074 +/- 0.034 mm Hg/ml. both p less than 0.05 versus controls. respectively). Vena caval occlusion eliminated the shifts in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop with the pericardium present and absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).',\n",
       " '14, Changes in left ventricular volume, mass, and function during the development and regression of supraventricular tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Disparity between recovery of systolic versus diastolic function, Chronic supraventricular tachycardia causes a dilated cardiomyopathy in man. Terminating this tachycardia appears to result in symptomatic improvement; however. its effects on left ventricular (LV) volume. mass. and function have not been fully examined. Accordingly. hemodynamic studies using simultaneous echocardiography and catheterization were performed in three groups of pigs: 1) those subjected to rapid left atrial pacing (240 beats/min) for 3 weeks (SVT. n = 8). 2) those subjected to supraventricular tachycardia for 3 weeks followed by termination of pacing and a 4-week recovery period (PSVT. n = 9). and 3) sham-operated controls (CTR. n = 10). Systolic pump function was assessed using fractional shortening (FS). peak ejection rate [peak (-)dD/dt]. and maximum rate of pressure development [peak (+)dP/dt]. Diastolic function was assessed using the time constant of isovolumic pressure decline (tau). peak early diastolic filling rate [peak (+)dD/dt]. the chamber stiffness constant (Kc). and the myocardial stiffness constant (Km). Supraventricular tachycardia caused LV dilation (end-diastolic dimension [EDD] increased from 3.5 +/- 0.4 cm in CTR to 4.9 +/- 0.5 cm in SVT. p less than 0.05) but no change in LV mass (LV weight-to-body weight ratio [LV/BW]) was 2.58 +/- 0.3 g/kg in CTR and 2.66 +/- 0.4 g/kg in SVT). all indexes of systolic function became abnormal (FS fell from 30 +/- 4% in CTR to 13 +/- 5% in SVT. p less than 0.05). and the indexes of relaxation and filling were slowed (tau increased from 36 +/- 3 msec in CTR to 51 +/- 13 msec in SVT. p less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in Kc or Km. After terminating the supraventricular tachycardia. LV volume fell but remained greater than that in CTR (EDD was 4.2 +/- 0.4 cm in PSVT. p less than 0.05 versus CTR) and substantial LV hypertrophy developed (LV/BW was 3.48 +/- 0.5 g/kg in PSVT. p less than 0.05 versus CTR). Systolic function returned to normal (FS was 31 +/- 5% in PSVT) but diastolic function remained abnormal. In PSVT. tau remained prolonged (49 +/- 12 msec. p less than 0.05 versus CTR). Kc increased from 3.7 +/- 1.0 in CTR to 7.4 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.05). and Km increased from 4.4 +/- 1.5 in CTR to 13.9 +/- 9.7 (p less than 0.05). Thus. the improvement in systolic function that occurs after the termination of supraventricular tachycardia is associated with the development of LV hypertrophy and persistent diastolic dysfunction.',\n",
       " '23, Oral clofilium produces sustained lowering of defibrillation energy requirements in a canine model, The effect of long-term oral administration of antiarrhythmic drugs on defibrillation energy requirements is not well understood. We examined the effect of clofilium. a drug that prolongs cardiac action potential duration without slowing cardiac conduction. on defibrillation energy requirements and ventricular effective refractory periods in a canine model during a 3-week period. Epicardial patch electrodes were implanted in 12 dogs. and baseline testing was conducted under fentanyl anesthesia on day 7. An oral clofilium (100 mg/day) regimen was started on day 8. Six clofilium-treated and six control dogs underwent repeated testing on days 14. 21. and 28 after surgery. Truncated trapezoidal shocks were given repeatedly at various stored energies in random order; delivered current and impedance were measured; and delivered energy was calculated. The energy and current for 50% success in defibrillation (E50 and I50. respectively) were determined. For control animals. E50 increased by a mean 34 +/- 78%. 60 +/- 83%. and 69 +/- 122% compared with baseline (day 7) on days 14. 21. and 28. respectively. In contrast. E50 in clofilium-treated dogs decreased by 39 +/- 62%. 24 +/- 33%. and 32 +/- 15% on days 14. 21. and 28. respectively. Mean current requirements (I50) remained relatively stable compared with baseline in control animals (-7 +/- 39%. +25 +/- 36%. +40 +/- 75% on days 14. 21. and 28. respectively). After clofilium administration I50 decreased by 36 +/- 22%. 32 +/- 17%. and 33 +/- 17% on days 14. 21. and 28. respectively.',\n",
       " '23, Magnitude and time course of extracellular potassium inhomogeneities during acute ischemia in pigs. Effect of verapamil, Prior studies have demonstrated the presence of inhomogeneities in myocardial [K+]e after serial 10-minute occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the pig. even within restricted locations of an ischemic zone. These inhomogeneities are thought to underlie the electrophysiological abnormalities responsible for lethal ventricular arrhythmias through reentrant and nonreentrant pathways. but a clear association has not been demonstrated. As a prerequisite to establishing this association. these studies were performed to establish measurement standards for [K+]e inhomogeneity. to quantify the magnitude and time course of these inhomogeneities. to determine whether the inhomogeneities are greater in the ischemic border where lethal ventricular arrhythmias are known to originate. and to assess the effect of a known antifibrillatory drug on [K+]e inhomogeneities. [K+]e (expressed as the change in potassium equilibrium potential. dEK [mV]) was measured in 15 preparations using an average of 17 closely spaced. critically calibrated K(+)-sensitive electrodes having stable response characteristics. A series of four 10-minute occlusions each separated by a 50-minute reperfusion period were performed in each study. In half of the studies. intravenous verapamil (0.2 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.0065 mg/kg/hr) was administered before the fourth occlusion. In nine studies (five control and four verapamil). electrodes were placed in the marginal ischemic zone (from 2 mm outside to 5 mm inside the visible cyanotic border). In six other studies (three control and three verapamil). electrodes were placed in the central ischemic zone (10-20 mm within the ischemic region). We determined that the standard deviation is the best measure of inhomogeneity and that 12 equivalent measurement sites are required to estimate it with a satisfactory degree of statistical confidence. We found that after 10 minutes of ischemia. mean dEK was 1.6 times greater in the central than in the marginal ischemic zone. whereas mean standard deviation at the same time was 1.5 times greater in the marginal than in the central ischemic zone. Verapamil reduced mean dEK and mean standard deviation in both ischemic zones for most of the occlusion by delaying the rise in [K+]e and the inhomogeneity of that rise by 3-5 minutes. Comparisons of mean dEK with mean standard deviation revealed a steep linear relation in the marginal zone and a curvilinear relation in the central zone where higher mean dEK values were not accompanied by higher values for mean standard deviation. Furthermore. we determined that these relations were not altered by verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).',\n",
       " '14, A new method for quantification of regurgitant flow rate using color Doppler flow imaging of the flow convergence region proximal to a discrete orifice. An in vitro study, While color Doppler flow mapping has yielded a quick and relatively sensitive method for visualizing the turbulent jets generated in valvular insufficiency. quantification of the degree of valvular insufficiency has been limited by the dependence of visualization of turbulent jets on hemodynamic as well as instrument-related factors. Color Doppler flow imaging. however. does have the capability of reliably showing the spatial relations of laminar flows. An area where flow accelerates proximal to a regurgitant orifice is commonly visualized on the left ventricular side of a mitral regurgitant orifice. especially when imaging is performed with high gain and a low pulse repetition frequency. This area of flow convergence. where the flow stream narrows symmetrically. can be quantified because velocity and the flow cross-sectional area change in inverse proportion along streamlines centered at the orifice. In this study. a gravity-driven constant-flow system with five sharp-edged diaphragm orifices (ranging from 2.9 to 12 mm in diameter) was imaged both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of flow through the orifice. Color Doppler flow images were produced by zero shifting so that the abrupt change in display color occurred at different velocities. This \"aliasing boundary\" with a known velocity and a measurable radial distance from the center of the orifice was used to determine an isovelocity hemisphere such that flow rate through the orifice was calculated as 2 pi r2 x Vr. where r is the radial distance from the center of the orifice to the color change and Vr is the velocity at which the color change was noted. Using Vr values from 54 to 14 cm/sec obtained with a 3.75-MHz transducer and from 75 to 18 cm/sec obtained with a 2.5-MHz transducer. we calculated flow rates and found them to correlate with measured flow rates (r = 0.94-0.99). The slope of the regression line was closest to unity when the lowest Vr and the correspondingly largest r were used in the calculation. The flow rates estimated from color Doppler flow imaging could also be used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler measurements of the maximal velocity of flow through the orifice to calculate orifice areas (r = 0.75-0.96 correlation with measured areas).',\n",
       " '14, Effects of pressure and volume of the receiving chamber on the spatial distribution of regurgitant jets as imaged by color Doppler flow mapping. An in vitro study, Regurgitant jet dimensions imaged by color Doppler flow mapping have been used to evaluate the severity of valvular insufficiency in clinical studies. To study the effect of pressure and volume within the receiving chamber on the magnitude of spatial distribution of regurgitant jets assessed by color Doppler techniques. we designed a simple constant-flow model in which a jet was driven through a known orifice (1.5 mm2) into a compliant receiving chamber by a steady-flow pump. A distal tube at the outflow closed the system and maintained the volume of the chamber constant during pump operation. We varied flow rate from 60 to 270 ml/min into elastic balloons with different static compliances of 1. 2. 4.5. and 9 ml/mm Hg (pressures of 57. 28. 18. and 8 mm Hg. respectively); the balloons served as receiving chambers at the constant volume of 150 ml. We also evaluated the effect of different volumes of a receiving chamber (110. 130. and 150 ml and pressures of 5. 15. and 24 mm Hg) with a static compliance of 2 ml/mm Hg over the same range of flow rates. For each of the different balloons. jet area correlated linearly with the jet velocity across the orifice (r = 0.98. 0.99. 0.98. and 0.97) and also with flow rate (r = 0.97. 0.99. 0.98. and 0.99). At the same flow rate and volume of receiving chamber. however. the jet area imaged by color Doppler decreased as the pressure in the receiving chamber increased. although receiving-chamber volume was constant.',\n",
       " '4, Calcium transport by plasma membranes from a glucose-responsive rat insulinoma, Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from a glucose-responsive rat insulinoma showed an ATP- and Mg2(+)-dependent uptake of Ca2+. The Km (concentration giving half-maximal activity) for Ca2+ was 60 nM. In the presence of 0.4 microM free Ca2+. the Km for ATP was 15 microM. and the Km for Mg2+ was 4 microM. Glucose (30 mM) decreased Ca2+ uptake by 50%. while other insulin secretagogues had no effect. except for glyceraldehyde. which stimulated Ca2+ uptake. Calmodulin increased the uptake of Ca2+. while trifluoperazine and vanadate inhibited the uptake. The Ca2(+)- and Mg2(+)-dependent ATPase from this tumor has a 10- to 20-fold higher requirement for Ca2+. which suggests that this enzyme is not responsible for Ca2+ transport. rather. Ca2+ transport activity represents only a small fraction of the total Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. The physiological importance of Ca2+ transport in insulin secretion is evident from the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by glucose. which leads to a decrease in Ca2+ efflux from the cell. This inhibition would lead to an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and insulin release.',\n",
       " '23, The pituitary-adrenocortical system of neonatal rats is responsive to stress throughout development in a time-dependent and stressor-specific fashion, The responsiveness of the neonatal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress has been thought to be impaired or diminished during the first 2 weeks of life. Although we previously found full responsiveness of the hypothalamus-pituitary unit to adrenalectomy in young rats [days (d) 5-10]. we failed to measure a significant increase in ACTH 10 min after ether administration until d14 of age. These studies were. therefore. designed to test the functional activation of the HPA axis after a single or repeated exposures to stress. Both qualitative (time-course. stressor-specific. circadian) and quantitative changes in the ACTH and corticosterone (B) responses to various stressors were tested during the first 10 days of life. Exposure to 3 min of ether vapor increased ACTH and B secretion (P less than 0.05-0.01) in 1-. 5-. and 10-d-old rats. with an increasing amplitude of both ACTH and B responses as a function of age. Peak secretion of ACTH occurred 5 min after the onset of stress (122 +/- 3.8 to 359 +/- 54 pg/ml on d1-10). while the time of maximal B increased as a function of age. Other stressors. such as maternal separation (12 h). cold (4 C; 60 min). or histamine injection (4 mg/kg BW. ip). provoked significant and stressor-specific ACTH and B responses in 10-d old rats. Histamine administration increased ACTH secretion above that of vehicle-injected rats. with a peak of secretion 15 min after drug injection (272 +/- 29 vs. 127 +/- 8 pg/ml; P less than 0.01). Histamine-induced B secretion peaked at 60 min (3.7 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl). In contrast to early responses observed after ether. separation. or histamine stress. cold stress in 10-d-old pups caused a large ACTH and B release 4 h after the onset of cold compared to that in maternally deprived pups [ACTH: cold. 457 +/- 61 pg/ml; separated. 150 +/- 14 (P less than 0.01); B: cold. 3.3 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl; separated. 1.8 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.05)]. We did not detect morning-evening (AM-PM) differences in either the pattern or the magnitude of the ACTH or B response to maternal separation or cold stress. Suppression of cold-induced ACTH release by B injection (1 mg/kg BW) 2 h before stress was observed until 4 h after stress in the AM and PM. whereas when given after cold. B was less effective in the PM than in the AM at preventing the rise in ACTH levels observed at 4 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).',\n",
       " '23, Intra-arterial urokinase as the initial therapy for acutely ischemic lower limbs, Acute ischemia of the lower limb remains a significant risk to both life and limb. Mortality rates of approximately 10-30% and amputation rates of the same magnitude in the survivors are repeatedly reported despite advances in medical and surgical techniques. Our experience. which utilized percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolysis as the initial treatment in 72 instances (63 patients). has resulted in a markedly lower mortality rate of 1.6% and a lower amputation rate of 8.5% in the survivors. Careful categorization by clinical degree of ischemia indicates that 82% of the cases were either threatened or irreversible limb ischemia. The initial treatment with thrombolysis did not preclude subsequent prompt surgical treatment when necessary; in these cases. thrombolysis promoted improved surgical results (100%) when it was successful. It markedly reduced the need for urgent surgery. usually simplified the subsequent surgical approach. diminished the overall need for surgery. and often accomplished a successful outcome alone (31%). Significant bleeding was not noted during subsequent surgical procedures and was noted in only 2.8% of the cases. Confirmation of these results and further improvements in technique might justify the use of an initially high-dose urokinase transcatheter infusion regimen as the initial treatment of choice for acute lower-limb ischemia.',\n",

Our results are expressed as reactivity coefficients. The mean of AGP reactivity coefficients (AG-RC +/- SD) in PMR (0.92 +/- 0.17) and GCA/PMR (0.91 +/- 0.12) were significantly lower compared with the mean AG-RC in patients with PM/DM (1.48 +/- 0.52) as well as in healthy individuals (1.34 +/- 0.9). Moreover. an additional microheterogeneous form of AGP was noted in patients with PM/DM. In parallel. we also found that the mean of ACHT reactivity coefficients (AC-RC +/- SD) were lower in patients with PMR (2.94 +/- 1.24) and GCA/PMR (1.66 +/- 0.16) compared with healthy individuals (3.92 +/- 1.17). The mean of AC-RC in patients with PM/DM (6.74 +/- 4.35) was significantly higher than in patients with PMR and GCA/PMR as well as in healthy individuals. Our results show that the changes in reactivity of AGP and ACHT with Con-A are useful diagnostic markers for the differentiation of PMR and GCA/PMR from PM/DM.',\n",

Application to the pathophysiology of sickle cell dehydration, We developed a mathematical model of the reticulocyte. seeking to explain how a cell with similar volume but much higher ionic traffic than the mature red cell (RBC) regulates its volume. pH. and ion content in physiological and abnormal conditions. Analysis of the fluxbalance required by reticulocytes to conserve volume and composition predicted the existence of previously unsuspected Na(+)-dependent Cl- entry mechanisms. Unlike mature RBCs. reticulocytes did not tend to return to their original state after brief perturbations. The model predicted hysteresis and drift in cell pH. volume. and ion contents after transient alterations in membrane permeability or medium composition; irreversible cell dehydration could thus occur by brief K+ permeabilization. transient medium acidification. or the replacement of external Na+ with an impermeant cation. Both the hysteresis and drift after perturbations were shown to depend on the pHi dependence of the K:Cl cotransport. a major reticulocyte transporter. This behavior suggested a novel mechanism for the generation of irreversibly sickled cells directly from reticulocytes. rather than in a stepwise. progressive manner from discocytes. Experimental tests of the model's predictions and the hypothesis are described in the following paper.\",\n",

These techniques are dependent on satisfactory percutaneous access and nephrostomy tract dilation. We used the Collings knife electrode for the creation of a nephrostomy tract in 17 patients (19 renal units) with difficult percutaneous access due to scarification. or the inability to advance a guide wire sufficiently for stabilization and dilation by conventional means. A nephrostomy tract was established successfully in all 19 procedures requiring an average of 12 minutes. Two major complications occurred that required blood transfusion and an open operation. Endourological treatment was successful in the remaining 17 cases. We believe that this technique provides an alternative to an open operation when standard access and dilation methods for endourological procedures are unsuccessful.',\n",

However. resection of the glenoid portion of the scapula and total scapulectomy result in an unsightly shoulder. In an attempt to minimize the functional impairment and restore stability and cosmesis. scapular glenoid allografts offer a reasonably good biologic replacement. This report describes the cases of a 45-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man in whom massive osteoarticular allografts were used. In one patient. good stability. cosmesis. and function were restored after resection of the glenoid portion. In the other patient. shoulder stability. cosmesis. and limited function were restored after total scapulectomy. No reports of scapular allografts seem to have been previously published in the literature.',\n",

These changes are associated with increased cross-link formation. We used X-ray diffraction to study these changes in human extensor tendons at a molecular level in relation to both aging and diabetes. Our results indicate that diabetes induces significant alterations in the ultrastructure of collagen in the lateral packing of the molecules and the axial structure of the specimen. These changes can be induced in normal tendon by incubation in ribose and glucose-6-phosphate but are different from those associated with the normal process of aging.',\n",

A 2.5 MHz transducer connected to a diagnostic ultrasound machine was placed in a water tank facing pulsatile jets (duration. 0.5 second) obtained by a calibrated injector. Flow rate from 6 to 52 ml/sec were tested through a 5 mm diameter circular orifice. Four different three-dimensional inflow tract geometries were compared: (A) sharp-edged. (B) Venturi (funnel). (C) converging conical. and (D) diverging conical. Mean velocities of jets were measured by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. Driving pressures were also measured by means of a fluid-filled catheter. Two observers independently digitized contours of maximal color jet areas by computer system from two separate sets of experiments. Results are given as the mean values of the four measurements for each parameter. Jet areas were correlated to flow rate. with no difference from A through D. The shape (eccentricity) of jets was different between A and B (p less than 0.05). between B and D (p less than 0.01). and between C and D (p less than 0.01). The shape of jets was correlated with flow rate. continuous-wave velocity. and pressure gradient in B. C. and D but not in A. Measured pressure gradients and estimated gradients by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography were similarly correlated from A through D.',\n",

The Ethics and Social Impact Committee of the Transplant and Health Policy Center, Two arguments underlie a widespread unwillingness to consider patients with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver as candidates for transplantation. First. alcoholics are morally blameworthy. their condition the result of their own misconduct; such blameworthiness disqualifies alcoholics in unavoidable competition for organs with others who are equally sick but blameless. Second. because of their habits. alcoholics will not exhibit satisfactory rates of survival after transplantation; good stewardship of a scarce lifesaving resource therefore requires that alcoholics not be considered for liver transplantation. These arguments are carefully analyzed and shown to be defective. There is not good moral or medical reason for categorically precluding alcoholics as candidates for liver transplantation. It would. in addition. be unjust to implement such a preclusion simply because others might respond negatively if we do not.',\n",

A total of 68 patients were enrolled and evaluated for postresuscitation complications attributable to epinephrine. using a two-tailed t test. and contingency analysis. The 33 patients receiving high-dose epinephrine and 35 patients receiving standard-dose epinephrine were similar in demographics and variables known to affect outcome. There was no difference in potential complications between groups except serum calcium. which was 1.97 mmol/L (SD. 0.20) in the high-dose epinephrine group and 2.10 (SD. 0.20) in the standard-dose group. Hospital discharge rates (18% in the high-dose vs 30% in the standard-dose group) and neurological status on discharge were not significantly different.

       " '14, Role of ultrasonic tissue characterization to distinguish reversible from irreversible myocardial injury, Tissue characterization reflects structural and functional integrity of tissues. Inasmuch as reversible ischemia causes no structural damage and irreversible ischemia results in persistent structural myocardial damage. we postulated that ultrasonic tissue characterization can distinguish the two types of injuries. Anesthetized open chest dogs underwent 15 minutes (group 1. n = 5) and 90 minutes (group 2. n = 8) of acute total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia-infarction was confirmed with segment shortening. electronmicroscopic examination. and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5 (IBR5). a measure of ultrasonic backscatter. and Fourier coefficient of amplitude modulation (FAM). an index of cardiac cycle dependent variation in backscatter. were measured at baseline. during ischemia. and after reperfusion. Group 1 (reversible ischemia) showed an increase in IBR5 from -48 +/- 1.2 dB at control to -45 +/- 1.0 dB (p less than 0.01) during ischemia. which returned to baseline after reperfusion (-47 +/- 1.3 dB). FAM was blunted during ischemia (6.2 +/- 1.0 dB during control versus 1.2 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia. p less than 0.01) and recovered completely during reperfusion. Segment shortening was abolished during ischemia (18% +/- 3% during control versus -12% +/- 5% during ischemia. p less than 0.01) and recovered partially during reperfusion (4% +/- 5%). The group 2 animals with irreversible myocardial injury showed an increase in IBR5. from -49 +/- 1.2 dB during control to -44 +/- 1.0 dB during ischemia (p less than 0.01) and paradoxical bulging of the ischemic region (17% +/- 3% to -7% +/- 3%. p less than 0.01) during ischemia.',\n",
       " '14, Quantitative echocardiographic analysis of global and regional left ventricular function: a problem revisited, We recorded two-dimensional echocardiograms simultaneously with the respiration measurements of 20 normal subjects and 20 patients with anterior myocardial infarction. The apical long-axis and four-chamber views were quantitatively analyzed. Measurement variability of global ejection fraction and regional ejection fraction of 100 regions was calculated during inspiration and at end-expiration for two observers. To minimize variability. the endocardial contour was redefined and traced with an improved computer-assisted tracing system. Variability (absolute mean difference) between two beats at end-expiration was significantly less than during inspiration (p less than 0.05): for ejection fraction the variability at end-expiration was 3.4% and the variability during inspiration was 6.4% (mean. 54%; SD. 7%); for regional ejection fraction the variability at end-expiration was 11.8% and the variability during inspiration was 21.5% (mean. 56%; SD. 15%). Intraobserver and interobserver variability values of one beat at end-expiration for ejection fraction were 3.1% and 3.8%. respectively. and 9.5% and 12.8%. respectively. for regional ejection fraction. Variability in patients with myocardial infarction was comparable. This method of recording respiration and analyzing left ventricular function at end-expiration. with a new contour definition and tracing system. provides a measurement variability that is considerably less than that reported in previous echocardiographic studies and that is comparable to angiographic methods.',\n",
       " '21, The clinical course of osteoporosis in anorexia nervosa. A longitudinal study of cortical bone mass, Women with anorexia nervosa have reduced bone mass and may develop fractures. Neither the pathophysiology of this osteoporosis nor its natural history is known. To study the clinical course of osteoporosis. we followed up 27 women with anorexia nervosa for a median of 25 months (range. 9 to 53 months). At study entry. cortical bone density. measured by single-photon absorptiometry of the radial shaft. was low (mean +/- SD. 0.63 +/- 0.07 g/cm2) and inversely related to the duration of amenorrhea (r = -0.49). During follow-up. most patients gained weight (n = 19). took calcium supplements (n = 16). and exercised regularly (n = 22). but fewer than half reached 80% or more of ideal body weight (n = 11). resumed menses (n = 6). or received estrogen (n = 4). Cortical bone density was stable during follow-up for the group as a whole; the mean annual change (+/- SD) was +0.005 (+/- .015) g/cm2 (95% confidence interval. -0.0009 to +0.0109). There was no significant difference in the mean change in bone density between women who attained 80% of ideal weight and those who did not or between groups who did or did not regain menses. take estrogen or calcium. or exercise vigorously. Four fractures were clinically observed in three women during follow-up. The rate of 0.05 nonspine fractures per person-year (95% confidence interval. 0.02 to 0.13) exceeds that of normal women in this age range (relative risk. 7.1; 95% confidence interval. 3.2 to 18.5). We conclude that reductions in cortical bone density appear not to be rapidly reversed by recovery from anorexia nervosa and that anorectic women may have an increased risk of fracture.',\n",

We retrospectively studied 16 patients who were found to have spontaneous contrast present on two-dimensional echocardiograms. specifically noting their clinical characteristics. the reproducibility of this phenomenon. the presence of thrombi and embolic events. and prognostic implications. Diagnoses included ischemic heart disease in nine patients. dilated cardiomyopathy in six patients. and hypertensive cardiomyopathy in one patient. The mean ejection fraction was 17.6%. There were six thromboembolic events in four patients. The spontaneous contrast was reproducible for periods of time up to 39 months. Patients who had improvement in their left ventricular dysfunction or who underwent aneurysmectomy had disappearance of the spontaneous contrast. Those patients who had spontaneous contrast reproduced on subsequent echocardiograms did not seem to have a worse prognosis than patients with similarly depressed ventricular function. but a larger study is necessary to verify this.',\n",

To test the hypothesis that patient viewing of entertaining videotapes during echocardiographic examinations would reduce the need for sedation and that Doppler pressure gradients so obtained would correspond satisfactorily with subsequent catheterization pressure gradients. 38 patients (age. 5 to 64 months; mean age. 18.6 months) with a variety of cardiac defects were studied. Because of excessive activity. resistance. fear. or crying. all of these patients would have normally been sedated. Instead. an age-appropriate videotape was used for patient viewing. In 35 of 38 patients. complete examinations were obtained with video viewing with no sedation. Twelve study patients later underwent catheterization while receiving sedation. The Doppler pressure gradients obtained while patients were viewing videotapes corresponded well with catheterization (r = 0.94). However. those pressure gradients were higher than those obtained with catheterization (mean. 8.3 mm Hg). but there was only one significant discrepancy of 22 mm Hg. In this series. complete examinations were obtained without sedation in 92% of subjects who would have normally required sedation (p less than 0.001). with minimal reduction in the accuracy of prediction of subsequent sedated catheterization pressure gradients. This suggests that near baseline conditions existed while patients were viewing television. Video viewing during echocardiographic examinations appears to be advantageous.',\n",

This study was designed to assess current emergency physician use of available resources. DESIGN: Prospective evaluation by mail using a 49-item questionnaire. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All 170 emergency physicians in Utah. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: The response rate was 75.3% (128 of 170). Resources \"outside their own fund of knowledge\" were consulted \"occasionally\" to \"frequently\" by 98.3%. They used the following resources \"occasionally\" to \"frequently\": poison control center (PCC) (93.7%). toxicology textbook (77.6%). \"expert colleague\" (34.0%). and \"in-house POISINDEX\" (23.9%). They often contacted the PCC for toxicity information (93.7%) and management recommendations (87.3%) and for acute. symptomatic overdose cases (88.3%). They \"almost never\" contacted the PCC for adverse drug reactions (76.6%). pill identification (70.2%). consultation with physician toxicologist (68.1%). asymptomatic exposures (62.9%). chronic toxicity (50.4%). or solely to report the case to the American Association of Poison Control Centers data base (90.2%). Those who had access to in-house POISINDEX often did not consult the PCC (82.6%). Of those who did not have in-house POISINDEX. 42.8% contacted the PCC to access it. Providing access to physician toxicologist consultations was thought to be an important role for the PCC by 86.7%. but only 32% of physicians were using this option. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of emergency physicians in Utah consult the PCC only for acute. symptomatic overdoses. They view access to physician toxicologist consultation as an important role for the PCC but seldom use it. The availability of in-house POISINDEX decreases the likelihood of PCC consultations from emergency departments. The frequency of emergency physician consultation with the PCC may decrease as POISINDEX becomes available at more hospitals.',\n",

Results of the Massachusetts Model Systems for Blood Cholesterol Screening Project, Several previous studies that looked at the effects of labeling individuals as hypertensive found increases in psychosocial distress. diminished feelings of well-being. or absenteeism. Other studies found no such effects. Thus far. similar studies relating to labeling for high blood cholesterol levels have not been published. The Massachusetts Model Systems for Blood Cholesterol Screening Project investigated whether labeling effects occurred as a result of the community-based screening. education. and referral programs it conducted in Worcester and Lowell. Nine questions concerning perceptions of physical and psychological well-being were asked on a questionnaire given to screening participants. The same questions were asked as part of a follow-up questionnaire given to all individuals identified as having high blood cholesterol levels at one of the screenings. Comparison of the baseline and follow-up results did not demonstrate significant overall negative effects among any age. sex. racial. income. or educational groups. On the contrary. responses to many of the questions revealed small but statistically significant improvements in perceptions of physical and psychological well-being. The absence of negative labeling effects may be attributable to the positive. supportive approach to participant counseling taken by the project.',\n",

A retrospective survey of patients with both AIDS and renal disease revealed approximately two thirds of the patients were black. reflecting the demographics of the population with AIDS; 11% of patients had intravenous drug abuse as a risk factor for the development of AIDS; and 74% had acute renal failure. Of these patients. approximately equal proportions were black and white. Twenty-six percent of the population had chronic renal failure. but the overwhelming proportion were black. There were no differences between proportions of patients in age. sex. race. or risk factors in patients with acute renal failure and chronic renal failure. but there was a significant difference in the proportions of black and white patients with chronic renal failure. The reason for these differences is unknown. but differences in host responses to viral proteins. physiologic adaptations. or socioeconomic factors in these populations may play an important role in mediating the expression of renal disease in individual patients.',\n",

We describe a recent increase in the number of observed cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in West Virginia. This is the fifth report of a recent increase in the incidence of ARF in the Ohio Valley area in the last 4 years. In contrast to the other reports. nearly two thirds of our cases of ARF were in adults. more than half of whom had suffered previous bouts of ARF. In these adults with recurrences. none was taking prophylactic penicillin at the time of presentation. Carditis was present in seven adults. two without a history of carditis. Arthritis was present in all adult patients. These data indicate a possible geographic phenomenon related to the increased number of observed cases of ARF and document that ARF is not simply a disease of childhood. Furthermore. our findings highlight the need for extended penicillin prophylaxis for secondary prevention of ARF. especially for those with an increased risk of acquiring a streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection.',\n",

Recently. amiodarone has been shown to be rapidly effective in suppressing sustained. incessant ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in this setting. This study evaluated the time course of arrhythmia suppression and comparative efficacy of amiodarone versus bretylium in a canine model of reperfusion arrhythmias. Of 23 dogs subjected to a Harris two-stage coronary artery ligation followed by release. 18 demonstrated clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias and received either intravenous amiodarone. 5 mg/kg (9 dogs). or intravenous bretylium. 5 mg/kg (9 dogs). Direct-current shocks for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were administered as necessary. Amiodarone rapidly suppressed sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in this model with no dog in the amiodarone-treated group requiring cardioversion after completion of the 15-minute infusion versus 4 of 9 dogs in the bretylium-treated group (p less than 0.05). Amiodarone was more effective than bretylium in suppressing episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. and premature ventricular complexes. The blood pressure and heart rate decreased more after amiodarone administration than after bretylium administration. We conclude that. in the canine reperfusion arrhythmia model. amiodarone is rapidly effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and is more effective than bretylium.',\n",

Histology showed an intimal thickening after 14 days and the media. which in the controls consisted of eight to ten layers of myocytes. was reduced to six to eight cell layers. During the first 2 weeks the graft segments had an impaired contraction when exposed to Krebs solution with 124 mmol/L K+. whereas after 1 month and later the graft segments approached the controls or had even higher contractile force. The thromboxane mimic U-46619 elicited full contractile force at all times whereas the potency was significantly lower during the first 14 days. Noradrenaline was unable to induce contraction in the graft segments during the first 14 days. but at 30 and 60 days it had regained full contractile force and was significantly more potent (approximately 60 times) in the graft segments compared with the controls.

Of the 279 patients (92%) with follow-up information available. 31 (11%) were diagnosed with PCP. Only 68% of patients with PCP had typical chest roentgenograms. Regression analysis identified four independent predictors of PCP: diffuse or perihilar infiltrates. presence of mouth lesions. lactate dehydrogenase level more than 220 U/L. and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm/h or more. Using these four predictors. patients could be stratified into low-. intermediate-. and high-risk groups for PCP.

       " '10, Cerebral infarction in patients with nephrotic syndrome, We describe two adult patients who presented with acute cerebral infarction and were found to have a hypercoagulable state due to nephrotic syndrome. One patient had a deficiency of free protein-S. The other patient had a pulmonary embolus 4 months after the stroke. Our cases demonstrate that the hypercoagulable state associated with nephrotic syndrome can be associated with cerebral arterial thrombosis and infarction in adults. Examination of the urine remains an important part of the evaluation of patients with recent stroke. The presence of severe proteinuria and a low serum albumin content should prompt consideration of a hypercoagulable state. Our experience suggests that anticoagulant drugs may be required to reduce the risk of new thrombotic events.',\n",
       " \"12, Young's syndrome (obstructive azoospermia and chronic sinobronchial infection): a quantitative study of axonemal ultrastructure and function, The ultrastructure and function of nasal cilia and sperm tails were examined in 23 men with Young's syndrome and compared with data previously collected from 10 normal subjects. Quantitative electron microscopic assessment showed that sperm tails from patients with Young's syndrome contained significantly fewer central pair microtubules. radial spokes. and inner dynein arms. and their cilia contained less inner dynein arms than normal subjects. The Young's syndrome patients had normal in vitro ciliary beat frequency (11.4 +/- 0.9 Hz). and 12 of the 23 had normal nasal mucociliary clearance (15.0 +/- 5.0 minutes). However. the remaining 11 had markedly abnormal nasal mucociliary clearance in vivo. In these patients. the deficiency of ciliary inner dynein arms did not appear to affect ciliary function in vitro but may under mucus loading lead to abnormal in vivo ciliary function. The consistent abnormalities shown in cilia and sperm tails. though apparently minor. constitute a common factor in both the reproductive and respiratory tracts which may. in combination with abnormalities in the in vivo environment. lead to the features of Young's syndrome.\",\n",
       " '18, Effect of hypoxia on cerebral metabolites measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in rats, Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a unique method to monitor noninvasively the concentrations of cerebral metabolites. N-Acetyl-L-aspartate. the concentration of which is assumed to be stable during hypoxia. has been used to form ratios with lactate. To determine the stability of the signal from N-acetyl-L-aspartate. we used a model of graded hypoxia in rats to monitor the percentage changes from baseline of the peak heights for lactate. lipids. and N-acetyl-L-aspartate. Anesthetized adult rats were exposed sequentially to 15% and 10% O2 while proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were collected with a surface coil in a 7-T 89-mm-bore spectrometer. Brain lactate concentration was either increased by feeding or infusion of glucose (n = 9) or lowered by fasting (n = 7). After death the brains were removed and frozen. and the water- and lipid-soluble compounds were extracted to identify the origin of the signals. We analyzed the data both as the percentage change from baseline for heights of the lactate (1.33 ppm). lipids (1.5 ppm). and N-acetyl-L-aspartate (2.02 ppm) peaks and as the ratios of heights of the 1.33 and 2.02 and the 1.5 and 2.02 ppm peaks. Both hypoxic episodes caused a 45% decrease from baseline in the 2.02 ppm peak. During the second hypoxic episode. the 1.33:2.02 ppm peak height ratio increased significantly in hyperglycemic rats (p less than 0.05) but was unchanged in hypoglycemic rats.',\n",

We studied random samples of the population 30-59 years of age for risk factors in two provinces of eastern Finland in 1972 and 1977. We then followed both cohorts until 1985 through linkage with national hospital discharge and death certificate registers. The prevalence of hypertension and smoking in both provinces declined between 1972 and 1977. as did the stroke incidence in the 8-year period of follow-up of each cohort. We observed no differences in stroke incidence between the two provinces. The relative risk of stroke in the later period (1977-1985) was 0.71 and 0.58 for men and women. respectively. when compared with the earlier period (1972-1980). Overall. 28% of all stroke events could be attributed to hypertension. 17% to smoking. and 43% to these two factors jointly. The decrease in the prevalence of hypertension and smoking accounted for about 29% of the decline.',\n",

Under halothane anesthesia. 30 rats had a 3-0 nylon suture introduced through the extracranial internal carotid artery to occlude the left middle cerebral artery. Nilvadipine was dissolved in polyethylene glycol 400. Immediately following occlusion. group 1 rats (n = 10) were treated subcutaneously with vehicle and group 2 and 3 rats were treated with 1.0 (n = 10) and 3.2 (n = 10) mg/kg nilvadipine. respectively. Perfusion fixation was performed 24 hours later. and the histopathologic outcomes were quantified. In group 1 infarct volume was 28.2 +/- 11.4% of the total cerebral volume; in groups 2 and 3 infarct volumes were 25.5 +/- 11.6% (NS) and 13.9 +/- 9.2% (p less than 0.05 different from group 1). respectively. Nilvadipine decreased ischemic neuronal injury in a dose-dependent manner and may be of use in the treatment of cerebral ischemia.',\n",
       " '10, The role of neutrophils and platelets in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke, Cerebral ischemia is accompanied by many of the cardinal features of acute inflammation such as neutrophil and platelet activation and accumulation. We sought to determine whether circulating neutrophils or platelets contribute to brain injury in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke that includes a fixed duration of superimposed systemic hypotension. We randomized 18 rabbits to receive either antineutrophil antiserum (n = 6). antiplatelet antiserum (n = 5). or nonimmune serum (n = 7). We assessed brain ischemia by measuring cerebral blood flow. intracranial pressure. and infarct size. Following the intracarotid administration of an autologous clot. cerebral blood flow in all groups fell to less than 5 ml/100 g/min during induced hypotension. After restoration of baseline blood pressure. mean cerebral blood flow in neutropenic animals recovered to 20-30 ml/100 g/min while that in control and thrombocytopenic rabbits remained at less than 10 ml/100 g/min. Intracranial pressure in control animals rose steadily to a final value of 241% of baseline. while a much smaller increase (148% of baseline) was noted in the thrombocytopenic group; no change from baseline was evident in the neutropenic group. Infarct size was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced in the neutropenic group but not in the thrombocytopenic group. These results suggest that neutrophils may be important contributors to ischemia-induced brain injury whereas the role of platelets is more subtle.',\n",
       " '23, Mild hypothermic intervention after graded ischemic stress in rats, We investigated the effect of mild (34 degrees C) postischemic hypothermia on hippocampal neuronal damage in 43 rats as a function of the duration of forebrain ischemia. Two temperatures and two durations were investigated. In two normothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 15) and 12 (n = 10) minutes. respectively. In two hypothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 9) and 12 (n = 9) minutes. respectively. and was followed immediately by the lowering and maintenance of rectal temperature to 34 degrees C for 2 hours. Seven days after the ischemic insult. the rats were sacrificed and the brains were prepared for histologic analysis; the percentage of necrotic neurons among the total neuronal population in selected CA1/2 sectors of the hippocampus was determined. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of necrotic neurons in the central (77.5% versus 55.5%. p = 0.006) and lateral (62.5% versus 38.9%. p=0.005) areas and in the overall CA1/2 sector of the hippocampus (71.8% versus 52.2%. p = 0.008) for the 8-minute hypothermic group compared with the 8-minute normothermic group. In contrast. no differences were detected in any area of the hippocampus between the 12-minute normothermic and the 12-minute hypothermic groups (p = 0.29-0.49). Our data indicate that mild postischemic whole-body hypothermia ameliorates neuronal survival when ischemia lasts 8 minutes but not 12 minutes.',\n",

Systolic ophthalmic artery blood velocity was reduced ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion (38.2 +/- 10.2 cm/sec) compared with the contralateral and control velocities (46.0 +/- 10.3 and 47.5 +/- 6.8 cm/sec. respectively; p less than 0.05). Ophthalmic systolic pressure measured by oculopneumoplethysmography was 94.7 +/- 13.2 mm Hg ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion compared with 108.4 +/- 15.3 mm Hg on the contralateral side (p less than 0.01). Transorbital and periorbital Doppler ultrasonography detected reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion in 44.0% and 40.0% of the patients. respectively. Systolic middle cerebral artery blood velocity was 55.2 +/- 22.3 cm/sec ipsilateral to an internal carotid artery occlusion compared with 79.4 +/- 23.5 cm/sec on the contralateral side (p less than 0.05) and 101.2 +/- 18.9 cm/sec in the controls (p less than 0.05). Reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow was associated with a low middle cerebral artery blood velocity and lack of major intracerebral collaterals. Transorbital Doppler ultrasonography permits noninvasive evaluation of the ophthalmic artery.',\n",
       " '10, Patient perception of tics and other movement disorders, To determine the subjective perception patients have of abnormal movements. 170 patients with various hyperkinesias were interviewed with questions directed at the \"voluntary\" or intentional versus \"involuntary\" aspects of their symptoms. One hundred and two of 110 patients with non-tic disorders thought that the abnormal movements were entirely involuntary. Forty-one of 60 tic disorder patients stated that all their motor and phonic tics were intentionally produced. Fifteen others had both voluntary and involuntary components. usually with the former predominating. A \"voluntary\" response could be used to predict the correct diagnostic category (tic versus non-tic) in 8 of 9 patients for whom the referral category was incorrect. These results suggest that a large proportion of the motor and phonic symptoms experienced by tic patients are irresistibly but purposefully executed. more akin to compulsions than to the other \"involuntary\" hyperkinesias with which they are commonly discussed.',\n",
       " '21, Flumazenil: a new benzodiazepine antagonist, Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects of benzodiazepines. It acts by binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and competitively blocking benzodiazepine activation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Animal studies and some human studies appear to demonstrate that flumazenil has weak intrinsic agonist activity; on the other hand. studies are inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent. Evidence available suggests that flumazenil is well tolerated in human beings over a broad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does not produce serious adverse effects. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose. flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes. with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Repeat doses can be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines. Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration; should this drug receive approval. it is likely to be used in emergency departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings. First. it could be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has been administered to facilitate medical. orthopedic. and surgical procedures. particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second. flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have taken benzodiazepine overdoses. Although most of these patients can be managed successfully with supportive therapy alone. it is possible that the use of flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term endotracheal intubation. Finally. flumazenil could have both diagnostic and therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown etiology. particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration. Because flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced respiratory and CNS depression. it could be used empirically to confirm or exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in turn might obviate the need for further expensive (eg. computed tomography) and sometimes invasive (eg. lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This might be particularly useful because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus. there are no signs or symptoms that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated on clinical grounds. Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of this new agent.',\n",

The average follow-up was 5.0 years and included clinical. dental. and cephalometric examinations according to a prescribed protocol. The study demonstrated that the procedure could be safely performed in the younger child with an acceptable level of morbidity. There was a remarkable degree of postoperative stability of the maxillary segment. However. although vertical (inferior) growth or movement of the midfacial segment was demonstrated. there was minimal. if any. anterior or horizontal growth. Any occlusal disharmony developing during the period of follow-up could be attributed to anticipated mandibular development and could be corrected by orthognathic surgery. The roles of surgical overcorrection and anterior-pull headgear therapy after release of intermaxillary fixation are also discussed. The Le Fort III osteotomy is justifiably indicated during early childhood for psychological and physiologic reasons.\",\n",

Shortness of the central portion of the face represented by a wide. short nose and anterior open bite is frequently combined with the exaggerated interorbital distance. With the mobilization of the two halves of the face it is possible to approximate the orbits. simultaneously elongating the center of the face and normalizing the maxillary alveolar ridge. A technique is described to plan the operation geometrically in order to predict accurately the skeletal correction. the change of the inclination of the eye slant. and the modification of the axis of the teeth.',\n",

Embolization was performed simultaneously with superselective angiography of the branches of the external carotid artery. The new biodegradable fibrosing agent Ethibloc was used in 16 cases. Histologic examination of the surgical specimens confirmed the good target orientation by the transarterial injection of Ethibloc. Limitations of this technique are discussed. The agent proved to have thrombogenic and fibrogenic properties. Some of the vascular walls degenerated and ruptured following the embolization. but there were no instances of necrosis of interstitial tissue or skin. Embolization treatment of vascular malformations of the face was not curative. but it facilitated subsequent surgery in all examined cases.',\n",
       " '7, One-stage closure of the entire primary palate, Timing of the closure of the anterior palate and alveolus is a subject of debate. Late repair of this defect is complicated by high fistula formation and subjects the patient to the problems of palate fistula for extended periods of time. We have utilized a single procedure performed when the child is 3 months of age that completely closes the anterior hard palate and alveolus along with the cleft lip. Our series consisted of 61 consecutive patients with unilateral clefts of the primary and secondary palate. Mucosal turnover flaps from the vomer along with lateral nasal mucosal flaps provide the nasal lining. A buccal sulcus flap with a Veau flap completes the oral repair. Ninety-five percent (58 of 61) of the patients had complete and stable closure of their anterior palate and alveolus after 1 year. The incidence of fistula formation in our series (3 of 61) is much lower than that reported with the utilization of other protocols. Excellent exposure of the anterior palate and alveolar defect during lip repair. early restoration of anatomic relationships. establishment of a good nostril floor and sill. and very low fistula formation are among the benefits of this procedure. The increase in operative time is considered minimal in light of aforementioned advantages.',\n",

In these patients. a consistent and useful ability to soften and flatten heaviness and bulkiness in the lateral upper orbital region was seen. Two patients developed postoperative hematoma. and two different patients had transient dry-eye symptoms following blepharoplasty. Twenty percent of patients had a transient degree of numbness in the lateral supraorbital nerve region. and all patients noted some transient numbness over the lateral upper brow region. No patient demonstrated significant paralysis of the orbicularis oculus or corrugator muscle. From this experience. retro-orbicularis oculus fat resection would appear to be a useful adjunct to standard blepharoplasty techniques in selected patients.',\n",

To determine the long-term outcome from this surgery. the records of 96 patients who had undergone chest-wall resection with musculocutaneous flap reconstruction were reviewed. Median survival for the entire group was 20.5 months. but a more accurate prediction of outcome could be obtained by dividing the patients into three groups. In group I. patients free of known malignancy and undergoing resection of radionecrotic tissues. median survival was 60.0 months. In group II. patients with resectable disease and free of tumor following surgery. median survival was 31.1 months. In group III. patients incompletely resected or known to have metastatic disease following surgery. median survival was only 12.5 months. Even in group III. however. some individuals achieved prolonged survival and lasting benefits from the surgery. so these data should not be used to exclude patients from undergoing necessary palliative procedures.',\n",

T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. CT enhanced with contrast material. and selective spinal arteriography. The stroma between the osseous trabeculae was found to correspond to either fatty tissue or soft tissue or both. All 11 asymptomatic VHs showed complete fatty stroma at CT and increased signal intensity at MR imaging. In contrast. all four compressive VHs had soft-tissue attenuation at CT. Three compressive VHs showed low signal intensity on MR images. Predominantly fatty stroma at CT and increased signal intensity at MR imaging were associated with normal or only slightly increased vascularization at selective spinal arteriography or contrast-enhanced CT. while soft-tissue stroma at CT and low signal intensity at MR imaging were associated with distinct hypervascularization. The authors' experience suggests that fatty VHs may represent inactive forms of VH. while soft-tissue content at CT and low signal intensity at MR imaging may indicate a more active vascular lesion with potential to compress the spinal cord. CT and MR imaging may be especially valuable for evaluating patients with clinical signs or symptoms of uncertain origin and findings compatible with VH at plain radiography.\",\n",
       " '23, Management of infants at risk for occult bacteremia: a decision analysis, Because febrile infants with no obvious source of bacterial infection may have bacteremia. and because bacteremia is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds. we used decision analysis to evaluate whether such infants should be treated with antibiotics. tested further. or sent home. Using a simple decision tree. we found that the decision to give empiric antibiotic treatment is the decision of choice. The difference in quality-adjusted life expectancy between the \"best\" and \"worst\" decisions was only 11 days. However. this difference translated to prevention of death or permanent disability in 60 cases per 100.000 febrile children. Further. empiric treatment remained the best management alternative unless the probability of bacteremia was less than 1.4% (less than any published prevalence). or the efficacy of treatment was less than 21%. Our analysis demonstrated that a test with far greater sensitivity than leukocyte count or other tests currently in use is needed to justify testing rather than treating empirically. Further. an enormous patient population would be needed to find a difference of both clinical and statistical significance between treated and untreated patients in a controlled trial. In the absence of such trials. we recommend blood culture and empiric antibiotic treatment of all infants at risk for occult bacteremia.',\n",
       " '6, Prostaglandin E2-induced diarrhea in mice: importance of colonic secretion, The present study has investigated the basis for induction of diarrhea by prostaglandin (PG)E2 in mice. When given i.p.. PGE2 induced a dose- and time-dependent diarrhea; the shortest post-treatment time for diarrhea onset was approximately 7 min. at a PGE2 dose of 200 micrograms/kg. At this dose. PGE2 also produced accumulation of fluid in the small intestine and in the colon (enteropooling). The enteropooling reached its maximum by 9 min and did not decrease until approximately 11 min (i.e.. 2 to 4 min after the mean time for diarrhea onset). PGE2 treatment altered neither gastric emptying nor gastrointestinal propulsion. but strongly enhanced the expulsion of a glass bead from the colon (i.e.. decreased the time to bead expulsion). The shortest time to expulsion of the glass bead was observed at 200 micrograms/kg i.p. The induction of diarrhea by PGE2 was unaffected by cecectomy. or sham-cecectomy. but the dose-response curve for time to onset of diarrhea by i.p. PGE2 was displaced to the right in animals with ligations of the ileo-ceco-colonic (ICC) junctions. The intraluminal fluid accumulation in the colon. evaluated in mice with ICC ligations. was increased by PGE2 administration within 2 min and remained greater than in vehicle-treated animals until the onset of diarrhea. The stimulation of colonic bead expulsion produced by i.p. PGE2 in control mice was not observed in animals with acute ICC ligations. even at i.p. doses up to 800 micrograms/kg.',\n",
       " '23, Enantiomers of oxybutynin: in vitro pharmacological characterization at M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors and in vivo effects on urinary bladder contraction, mydriasis and salivary secretion in guinea pigs, The major side effects of racemic oxybutynin (OXY). which is used in the treatment of urinary incontinence are dry mouth (xerostomia) and blurred vision (mydriasis). Highly purified enantiomers of OXY [(R)OXY. (S)OXY] were compared with the racemate both in vitro in functional studies and in vivo in guinea pigs to evaluate their pharmacological action relative to their adverse effects. The affinity of (R)OXY and (S)OXY for different muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined using field stimulated rabbit vas deferens (M1) and guinea pig atria (M2) or bladder (M3) strips. Stereoselective antimuscarinic effects [(R)OXY greater than or equal to (R/S) OXY much greater than (S)OXY] were evident at all three receptor subtypes; the isomeric ratio [(S)OXY/(R)OXY] ranged from 12 to 88. Both (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY were slightly more selective (2-4-fold. P less than .01) for M1 and M3 relative to M2 muscarinic receptors. Stereoselectivity was also evident in vivo for volume-induced urinary bladder contractions as measured by cystometrogram parameters [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 21]. mydriasis [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 136] and salivary gland secretory responses [(S)OXY/(R)OXY approximately 30]. The absolute potencies of (R)OXY or (R/S)OXY for mydriasis and salivation were similar to those for inhibition of intravesical bladder pressure. Also. (R)OXY and (R/S)OXY equipotently antagonized cholinergic-mediated CNS effects in mice. Collectively. the data suggest that the activity of (R/S)OXY resides predominantly in the (R)-enantiomer. However. it appears that (R)OXY may offer no significant pharmacological advantage over (R/S)OXY in terms of its principal therapeutic and side effect profile.',\n",
       " '10, Asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle in infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation, Lateral cerebral ventricular volume in 36 preterm infants with or without an intraventricular hemorrhage. and with or without posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. was measured longitudinally and compared with the ventricular index measurements of the same ventricles. A poor correlation was found (r2 = 0.67). To determine a reason for this poor relationship. we analyzed the volumes of the regions of the ventricles by a segmental volume analysis. The occipital region of the lateral cerebral ventricle enlarged at a much faster rate (1.904 +/- 0.477 ml/day) than either the anterior region (0.546 +/- 0.253 ml/day; p less than 0.01) or the middle region (-0.209 +/- 0.334 ml/day; p less than 0.01) in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The rate of growth of the middle region of the lateral cerebral ventricles was the same for all infants. Linear indexes. such as the ventricular index and the lateral ventricular ratio. do not allow for accurate serial estimates of ventricular size in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus because of asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle. We conclude that sequential volume measurements are more useful than ventricular index measurements to follow ventricular size sequentially in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.',\n",

The drug. a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. was taken orally for 6 months. Serum lipid concentrations were determined monthly. Computed tomography of the liver was performed before and during therapy to evaluate liver fat content. The younger sister had liver biopsies before and after 6 months of lovastatin therapy to assess hepatic cholesterol stores. Both patients had marked decreases in serum levels of cholesterol. triglycerides. and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels increased. Computed tomography during treatment demonstrated a significant increase in linear attenuation. suggesting a decreased liver fat content. Liver tissue obtained 6 months after lovastatin therapy was initiated had 13% less esterified cholesterol than the liver sample obtained before treatment. We conclude that lovastatin may be effective in treating children with cholesterol ester storage disease.',\n",
       " '21, Mandibular ramus anatomy as it relates to the medial osteotomy of the sagittal split ramus osteotomy, The sagittal split ramus osteotomy is probably the most frequently used procedure for correction of mandibular skeletal dentofacial deformities. Despite numerous improvements in the technique in the 30 years since the procedure was introduced. a number of troublesome complications still occur. These include unfavorable fracture during surgery. paresthesia. and relapse. The purpose of this study was to determine where fusion of the buccal and lingual cortical plates occurs in the upper mandibular ramus. as it is thought that placement of the horizontal medial osteotomy above the point of fusion (without any intervening medullary bone) may lead to unfavorable fracture during splitting. Forty-nine human mandibles were sectioned vertically at three locations perpendicular to the surface of the ramus and the occlusal plane. Measurements were made to locate vertically the point of fusion of the buccal and lingual cortical plates relative to the lingula and to the depth of the sigmoid notch. The point of fusion occurred between 7.5 and 13.3 mm above the lingula. Only 2% of mandibles had fusion at or below the level of the lingula in the anterior ramus. whereas in the posterior ramus. 6.1% of mandibles were fused at that level. At a level halfway from the lingula to the sigmoid notch. 20% of mandibles were fused in the anterior ramus. whereas in the mid- to posterior ramus. the incidence was as high as 39%. The location of the medial horizontal osteotomy should be at or just above the tip of the lingula. A higher level of cut may be associated with an increased difficulty in splitting or incidence of unfavorable fracture.',\n",

To determine if the effect of CS on airway disease is by reduction in LTB4. we studied serum LTB4 levels in clinically stable patients with asthma or COPD who were treated with or without CS. The LTB4 was extracted from serum and assayed by radioimmunoassay. Serum LTB4 concentrations. expressed as the mean +/- SD. were 0.36 +/- 0.15 ng/ml in ten normal controls. 0.56 +/- 0.18 ng/ml in nine asthmatic subjects. 0.67 +/- 0.2 ng/ml in eight asthmatic subjects receiving CS. 0.81 +/- 0.19 ng/ml in seven patients with COPD. and 0.97 +/- 0.29 ng/ml in eight patients with COPD receiving CS. Serum LTB4 levels in normal controls differed significantly from all groups with COPD or asthma (p less than 0.01). Levels of LTB4 in asthmatic subjects differed from levels in patients with COPD (p less than 0.03). and levels in asthmatic subjects receiving CS differed from subjects with COPD receiving CS (p less than 0.03). Concentrations of LTB4 within either the COPD or the asthmatic groups were not lower in the patients treated with CS. We conclude that serum LTB4 concentrations are higher in COPD than in asthma or normal controls and that administration of CS is not associated with low LTB4 levels. The beneficial effects of CS in obstructive airway disease appear to be mediated by mechanisms other than reduction of LTB4.',\n",

A review, Somatostatin is a naturally occurring cyclic tetradecapeptide that inhibits release of growth hormone and all gastrointestinal hormones. The beneficial effect of somatostatin in the treatment of certain hypersecretory disorders of hormone excess in well recognized; however its clinical usefulness has been limited in the past by its extremely short plasma half-life. The development of long-acting somatostatin analogues has provided clinically useful agents for treatment of hormone-producing tumors. In addition to well-known inhibiting effects on hormone release and actions. recent studies using experimental tumor models have demonstrated an antiproliferative effect of somatostatin and its analogues on growth of a variety of neoplasms. The exact role of somatostatin analogues in cancer therapy has yet to be established; however studies suggest that these agents could provide a useful and relatively nontoxic adjuvant therapy in the treatment of certain tumors. In this review. the oncologic application of somatostatin and possible mechanism of action are examined and current clinical and experimental studies are summarized.',\n",
       " '14, The spectrum of portal vein thrombosis in liver transplantation, Thrombosis of the portal vein with or without patency of its tributaries used to be a contraindication to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) until quite recently. Rapid progress in the surgical technique of OLTX in the last few years has demonstrated that most patients with portal vein thrombosis can be safely and successfully transplanted. Presented here is a series of 34 patients with portal vein thrombosis transplanted at the University of Pittsburgh since 1984. The various techniques used to treat various forms of thrombosis are described. The survival rate for this series was 67.6% (23 of 34 patients). Survival was best for patients who underwent phlebothrombectomy or placement of a jump graft from the superior mesenteric vein. The survival rate also correlated with the amount of blood required for transfusion during surgery. Overall it is concluded that a vast majority of the patients with thrombosis of the portal system can be technically transplanted and that their survival rate is comparable to that of patients with patent portal vein.',\n",

Young-onset PD patients had significantly higher frequency for both dyskinesias and fluctuations after both 3 and 5 years of levodopa. Young-onset PD patients also developed both levodopa-induced dyskinesias and fluctuations earlier than older-onset PD patients. We suggest that the introduction of levodopa therapy in patients with young onset PD should be postponed as long as possible.\",\n",

Median weight loss was 5 kg; 259 patients (31%) experienced no weight loss. By logistic regression analysis the authors found that weight loss increased with age and advancing stages of disease (TNM Stage I-IV). with decreasing Karnofsky index. in Lauren's diffuse versus intestinal tumor type. and with tumors located at the cardia/esophagus. Increasing weight loss reduced the resectability rate significantly. but no association between weight loss and postoperative complication rate was found. The odds ratio for postoperative mortality was 2.5 to 1 for the weight loss group 5 to 10kg versus 0 kg. In conclusion. weight loss reflects a less favorable tumor status. Weight loss did not increase postoperative morbidity but did lead Weight to a higher death rate after surgery.\",\n",

       " \"16, A dimorphic 4-bp repeat in the cystic fibrosis gene is in absolute linkage disequilibrium with the delta F508 mutation: implications for prenatal diagnosis and mutation origin, The gene causing cystic fibrosis (CF) has been recently cloned. and the major mutation (delta F508) accounting for approximately 70% of CF chromosomes has been uncovered. We have identified at the 3' end of intron 6 in the CF gene a 4-bp tandem repeat (GATT) that exhibits interesting features. First. PCR screening of 103 normal individuals revealed that the repeat exists only in two polymorphic allelic forms. either as a hexamer or a heptamer. These two alleles are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and predict a heterozygote frequency of 41% (p[seven repeats] = .71; q [six repeats] = .29). Second. the allele with six repeats was found linked to delta F508 on all 76 CF chromosomes investigated. demonstrating strong linkage disequilibrium and suggesting that delta F508 had originated on the gene bearing six repeats. Third. when the repeat alleles are linked to the DNA markers XV2c and KM19. extended haplotypes are generated. These new haplotypes become informative in situations in which prenatal diagnosis cannot be performed solely with XV2c and KM19. Since this repeat marker is located in the CF gene and would be very less likely to recombine with the gene. it can serve as a valuable DNA marker for haplotype analysis. A possible crossover. however. was identified between XV2c and KM19. transferring delta F508 to a different haplotype.\",\n",

Seven patients conceived while receiving treatment for their neoplasms; in 22 patients. the hematologic disease was diagnosed during pregnancy. and the remaining 27 patients became pregnant after completion of the antineoplastic treatment. When a comparison was made of the evolution of these pregnancies to that of pregnancies in a healthy population. no increase in the incidence of complications was observed: 64% of the pregnancies went to term. 9% resulted in spontaneous abortion. and 5% resulted in premature births. The observed incidence of one major malformation in 56 pregnancies did not differ from the frequency of malformations in the offspring of healthy individuals. There were no fetal losses in six pregnancies in which conception occurred during the first year after chemotherapy. In spite of the inherent limitations derived from the design of this type of study and the type of subject analyzed. the data here support the hypothesis that the cytostatic treatment of hematologic malignancies. if deemed necessary. should not be postponed because of pregnancy.

When the CoBF was above 30 ml/100 g/min. the safe period for temporary clipping applied distal to the perforators was 15 minutes. The occlusion time should be shortened when the CoBF is below 30 ml/100 g/min. Two patients suffered basal infarction. which was not detected by CoBF monitoring. Attention should be paid to the blood flow in the deep structures when a temporary clip is applied at a site proximal to the perforating branches.

Reperfusate composition: effects of leukocyte depletion of blood and blood cardioplegic reperfusates after acute coronary occlusion, OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the role of leukocyte depletion during initial reoxygenation with normal blood and blood cardioplegic reperfusates in limiting reperfusion damage. METHODS: Twenty-eight dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The initial reperfusate (37 degrees C) was delivered on total vented bypass to the left anterior descending artery by a calibrated pump via an internal mammary artery graft at 50 mm Hg for 20 minutes. Eight dogs received normal (normokalemic. nonenriched) blood reperfusion (leukocyte count 8000/mm3) and six were reperfused with leukocyte-depleted normal blood (leukocyte count less than 100/mm3). Of 14 dogs reperfused with substrate-enriched (hyperkalemic) blood cardioplegic solution. six received a cardioplegic solution with a leukocyte count less than 100/mm3. RESULTS: Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reduced reperfusion-induced arrhythmias from 63% to 17% (p less than 0.05). Coronary vascular resistance at initial reperfusion was low and remained low during substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic reperfusion with both normal and reduced leukocyte counts. In contrast. coronary vascular resistance rose 63% with normal blood reperfusion. and this increase was avoided by leukocyte depletion (2.6 versus 4.0 mm Hg x ml/min. p less than 0.05). Coronary vascular resistance after 20 minutes was. however. higher than that with blood cardioplegia with normal or decreased leukocyte counts. Negligible functional recovery followed reperfusion with normal blood and leukocyte-depleted blood (12% and 6% of control systolic shortening). In contrast. substantial segmental recovery followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion (73% systolic shortening. p less than 0.05) but was not improved by leukopheresis (81% systolic shortening). Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reperfusate reduced histochemical damage from 53% to 38% (p less than 0.05). but the least histochemical damage followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion with a normal or reduced leukocyte count (8% or 11%. p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important role for leukocytes in reperfusion damage. but reperfusate leukocyte filtration alone is inferior to blood cardioplegic reperfusion. Leukocyte depletion of blood cardioplegic solutions seems unnecessary after only 2 hours of ischemia.',\n",

Because incisional healing processes are difficult to quantify. a full-thickness excisional wound model in the rabbit ear was developed to permit detailed analyses of growth-factor-mediated tissue repair. In the present studies. quantitative and qualitative differences in acute inflammatory cell influx. glycosaminoglycan (GAG) deposition. collagen formation. and myofibroblast generation in PDGF-BB (BB homodimer)- and TGF-beta 1-treated wounds were detected when analyzed histochemically and ultrastructurally. Although both growth factors significantly augmented extracellular matrix formation and healing in 10-day wounds compared with controls (P less than 0.002). PDGF-BB markedly increased macrophage influx and GAG deposition. whereas TGF-beta 1 selectively induced significantly more mature collagen bundles at the leading edge of new granulation tissue (P = 0.007). Transforming growth factor-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts demonstrated active collagen fibrillogenesis and accretion of subfibrils at the ultrastructural level. Myofibroblasts. phenotypically modified fibroblasts considered responsible for wound contraction. were observed in control. but were absent in early growth-factor-treated granulating wounds. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of soft tissue repair and indicate that 1) PDGF-BB induces an inflammatory response and provisional matrix synthesis within wounds that is qualitatively similar but quantitatively increased compared with normal wounds; 2) TGF-beta 1 preferentially triggers synthesis and more rapid maturation of collagen within early wounds; and 3) both growth factors inhibit the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. perhaps because wound contraction is not required. due to increased extracellular matrix synthesis.',\n",
       " '7, S-100 protein antibodies do not label normal salivary gland myoepithelium. Histogenetic implications for salivary gland tumors, Neoplastically modified myoepithelial cells have a key role in developing the histologic characteristics of some salivary gland tumors. S-100 protein expressed in certain of these tumors is suggested to support this role. as the principal component in the human salivary gland reported to be S-100 protein-positive is myoepithelium. Confirmation of such an important aspect is required. Immunoperoxidase staining of parotid salivary gland shows considerably different patterns obtained with antibodies to S-100 protein. neuron-specific enolase. and neurofilaments compared with those for muscle-specific actin and cytokeratin 14; many more cells and their processes associated with acini and ducts are evident with the latter two antibodies. Double immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to either S-100 protein or neuron-specific enolase combined with muscle-specific actin does not reveal colocalization of these antigens in myoepithelial cells. The former localize only to nerve fibers adjacent to. but separate from. acini. and the latter only to myoepithelial cells. It is apparent that S-100 protein staining of the rich network of unmyelinated nerves in the interstitial tissues. evident ultrastructurally. has been misinterpreted as myoepithelium. This result has important implications for histogenetic classifications of salivary gland tumors.',\n",
       " '23, Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XXI. Reperfusate composition: superiority of blood cardioplegia over crystalloid cardioplegia in limiting reperfusion damage--importance of endogenous oxygen free radical scavengers in red blood cells, Postischemic damage is caused partially by oxygen free radical-mediated injury. This study will show that (1) crystalloid cardioplegia with room air oxygen is deleterious because it is devoid of free radical scavengers and (2) blood cardioplegia limits damage because it contains endogenous free radical scavengers in red blood cells. METHODS: Thirty-two dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 20 minutes of regional blood cardioplegic reperfusion on bypass. Ten dogs received only the blood cardioplegic solution (containing its endogenous free radical scavengers); five received initial blood cardioplegia (5 minutes) with endogenous free radical scavengers (catalase and glutathione peroxidase) blocked by aminotriazole and N-ethylmaleimide. respectively; 12 received initial crystalloid cardioplegic solution oxygenated by room air (oxygen tension = 150 mm Hg); seven without and five with exogenous free radical scavengers (superoxide dismutase. catalase. coenzyme Q10); five received initial deoxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution (oxygen tension = 6 mm Hg); and five received deoxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution. RESULTS: Blood cardioplegia with endogenous free radical scavengers produced the best recovery of systolic shortening (69% systolic shortening) and resulted in the least histochemical damage (11% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining). The worst recovery and most damage occurred if blood cardioplegia was preceded by oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia (3% systolic shortening. 48% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining; p less than 0.05 versus blood cardioplegia) or if free radical scavengers were blocked in the initial period of blood cardioplegia (3% systolic shortening. 41% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining; p less than 0.05 versus blood cardioplegia). Conversely. deoxygenation or supplementation of oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution with exogenous free radical scavengers restored 60% systolic shortening (p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia) and 54% systolic shortening (p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia) and reduced damage to 34% and 21% (both p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia). CONCLUSION: Blood cardioplegic solutions containing their own endogenous free radical scavengers are superior to crystalloid cardioplegic solutions. because they limit oxygen-mediated perfusion damage and restore contractile function. Initial crystalloid cardioplegic washout negates the salutary effect of blood cardioplegia. Exogenous free radical scavenger supplementation or deoxygenation of the cardioplegic reperfusate is necessary only if crystalloid cardioplegia is used.',\n",

       " '20, Serial CD4 lymphocyte counts and development of AIDS, Low CD4 lymphocyte counts are associated with increased risk of progression to AIDS in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We investigated the extent to which the timing of progression to AIDS can be explained solely in terms of decline of the CD4 lymphocyte count in 111 haemophiliacs followed for up to 11 years since infection with HIV. A median of 10 CD4 lymphocyte counts were made per patient. By applying a simple linear model for the decline in CD4 lymphocyte counts over time. we estimated the date of development of AIDS in 96 patients who had at least 5 determinations. 84% (81 of 96) of patients were correctly classified as to development of AIDS before Jan 1. 1990 (p less than 0.0001). with this model. The results suggest that differences in the time at which patients with HIV will progress to AIDS can largely be explained by differences in rates of decline of CD4 lymphocyte counts.',\n",

A positive result was defined as a mean dilution titre of 2 or more. Eight of eighteen BPSHL patients had positive titres--significantly (p less than 0.005) more than in any other group (one Meniere\\'s disease. two otosclerosis. and no others). The mean antibody titre was higher in the BPSHL group than in any other group (2.02 [SEM 0.62] vs 0.17 [0.17]) Meniere\\'s disease. 0.44 [0.32] otosclerosis. 0 all others; p less than 0.005). The nine BPSHL patients who showed a clinical response to corticosteroids (improvement in at least one tone by audiogram or 25 db in speech discrimination score) had the highest mean antibody titre (3.46 [0.88] vs 0.59 [0.59] for the nine non-responsive patients; p less than 0.04). We suggest that in some patients with BPSHL. immunity to type II collagen. a major constituent of the inner ear. may be important in the pathogenesis of the disorder.',\n",

To test the hypothesis that abnormal diastolic function at rest might reflect the functional severity of CAD. as estimated by exercise-induced ischemia. the relation between regional and global LV diastolic function at rest and during exercise-induced ischemia was evaluated in 49 patients with radionuclide angiography. All patients had normal systolic function at rest. Group 1 (n = 26) patients manifested a normal ejection fraction response to exercise and group 2 (n = 23) patients an abnormal response. Data obtained from 22 age-comparable normal volunteers were used for comparison. Although regional and global diastolic function were not different between normal subjects and group 1 patients. peak filling rate was lower in group 2 patients than in normal subjects (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic counts/s; p less than 0.01). Moreover. regional diastolic asynchrony. as assessed from the radionuclide data by using a regional sector analysis of the LV region of interest. was greater in group 2 patients (46 +/- 44 ms) than in both normal subjects (25 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05) and group 1 patients (23 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05). Thus. among patients with CAD and with normal LV systolic function at rest. impaired LV filling and regional asynchrony predict a greater degree of exercise-induced ischemia. suggesting a greater extent of jeopardized myocardium.',\n",

In 46% of patients single graft angioplasty was attempted. and in 54% of patients sequential graft angioplasty was attempted. The clinical primary success rate was 90%. In-hospital mortality was 0.7%. 2.8% of patients sustained a procedural myocardial infarction. and 1.3% of patients underwent emergency bypass surgery. After a follow-up period of 5 years. 74% of patients were alive. and 26% were alive and event-free (no myocardial infarction. no repeat bypass surgery or repeat angioplasty). In patients in whom the initial angioplasty attempt was unsuccessful. only 3% were event-free at 5 years. versus 27% of successfully dilated patients. The time interval between the angioplasty attempt and previous surgery was a significant predictor for 5-year event-free survival. The event-free survival rates for patients who had bypass surgery 1 year before. between 1 and 5 years. and 5 years before angioplasty. were 45. 25 and 19%. respectively. Less than one-third of patients with previous bypass surgery who had angioplasty of the graft remained event-free after 5 years. In patients needing angioplasty within 1 year after bypass surgery. better long-term results were achieved.',\n",

The majority of patients had prior (greater than 1 week) myocardial infarction (62 patients. 85%). Congestive heart failure and unstable angina were present in 24 (45%) and 49 (67%) patients. respectively. Multivessel coronary artery disease was present in 60 (83%). The LV ejection fraction ranged from 14 to 40% (mean 34%). Intraaortic balloon pump (15%) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support (4%) was used infrequently. Angiographic success was obtained in 109 of 128 lesions (85%) attempted. Complete revascularization was obtained in 16 of 60 patients with clinical success. Procedure-related mortality was 5% (4 patients). All patients were followed from greater than or equal to 6 to less than or equal to 71 months (average 26). The estimated survival was 79 +/- 5%. 74 +/- 6%. 66 +/- 7% and 57 +/- 8% at 1. 2. 3 and 4 years. respectively. A Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of congestive heart failure. a lower LV ejection fraction and a higher myocardial jeopardy score for contractile myocardium were independent predictors of survival after PTCA in patients with LV dysfunction. In conclusion. a high-risk subset can be identified among patients with severe LV dysfunction who undergo PTCA.',\n",

A total of 201 patients were randomized to placebo or to high-dose diltiazem (mean dose. 329 mg/day). Treatment began 24 hours before angioplasty. Restenosis was assessed by percent area stenosis as determined by quantitative angiographic techniques before. immediately and 1 year after angioplasty. All patients also received aspirin and dipyridamole before angioplasty. Heparin and verapamil were administered intravenously during the procedure. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age. extent of coronary artery disease. smoking history. and baseline lipid levels. Procedural complications. including death (1 vs 1). Q-wave infarction (0 vs 3). acute occlusion (5 vs 5) and focal spasm (0 vs 0). were not significantly different in the diltiazem and placebo patients. respectively. Freedom from all acute complications was noted in 85% of patients in both groups. One-year angiographic follow-up was obtained in 60% of patients. Restenosis rates were similar: 36% in the diltiazem group and 32% in the placebo group (p = 0.30). The incidence of late cardiac events (death. Q-wave myocardial infarction. recurrent angina or coronary bypass graft surgery) was similar in the 2 groups. Thus. diltiazem did not influence the overall restenosis rate or prevent late events after coronary angioplasty.',\n",

Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore. we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver.\",\n",

The Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial Research Group, The effect of diltiazem on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed in 2.377 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial and subsequently followed for 25 +/- 8 months. The study population included 855 patients (36%) with at least 1 prior AMI before the index infarction and 1.522 patients (64%) with a first AMI. of whom 409 (27%) had a first non-Q-wave AMI. 664 (44%) a first inferior Q-wave AMI. and 449 (30%) a first anterior Q-wave AMI. This post hoc analysis revealed that. among patients with first non-Q-wave and first inferior Q-wave AMI. there were fewer cardiac events during follow-up in the diltiazem than in the placebo group. and that the reverse was true for patients with first anterior Q-wave AMI or prior infarction. The diltiazem:placebo Cox hazard ratio (95% confidence limits) for the trial primary end point (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarction. whichever occurred first) was: first non-Q-wave AMI-0.48 (0.26. 0.89); first inferior Q-wave AMI-0.66 (0.40. 1.09); first anterior Q-wave AMI-0.82 (0.51. 1.31); and prior AMI-1.11 (0.85. 1.44). Use of cardiac death alone as an end point gave an even more sharply focused treatment difference: first non-Q-wave AMI-0.46 (0.18. 1.21); first inferior Q-wave AMI-0.53 (0.27. 1.06); first anterior Q-wave AMI-1.28 (0.68. 2.40); prior infarction-1.26 (0.90. 1.77). Further analysis revealed that these differences in the effect of diltiazem in large part reflected the different status of the 4 electrocardiographically defined subsets in terms of left ventricular function.',\n",

Both the exercise echocardiograms and SPECT studies were performed in conjunction with the same symptom-limited bicycle exercise test. The development of either a new wall motion abnormality or a reversible perfusion defect after exercise. or both. were regarded as a positive test for the exercise echocardiographic and SPECT studies. respectively. The results of these 2 diagnostic tests were compared with coronary arteriography. Exercise echocardiography identified 35 (71%) and SPECT 41 (84%. p = 0.13) of the 49 patients with significant CAD (defined as greater than 50% diameter stenosis). Twenty-five of the 26 patients (96%) without significant coronary stenosis had negative exercise echocardiographic results and 23 of 26 (88%) had negative SPECT results. Exercise-induced new wall motion abnormalities showed a good correlation with reversible perfusion defects. and the results of the 2 methods were concordant in 65 of 75 patients (agreement = 88%. kappa = 0.75 +/- 0.14). Both the diagnostic accuracy of exercise echocardiography and SPECT were significantly higher than the exercise ECG (81 vs 64%. p less than 0.02 and 88 vs 64%. p less than 0.005). The sensitivity and specificity for detecting individual diseased vessels were 60 and 95% for exercise echocardiography and 67 and 94% for SPECT.',\n",

Electrophysiologic studies before surgery yielded induction of monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 40 patients. whereas 8 were noninducible. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 58 +/- 12 years. Mean ejection fraction was 33 +/- 16%. Thirty patients (63%) had documented coronary artery disease; 14 patients (29%) had previous coronary bypass surgery. The mean intraoperative defibrillation threshold was 13.8 +/- 6.6 J. In 6 patients. an adjunctive right minithoracotomy was used to position 1 patch over the right atrium and thus optimize the defibrillation threshold. Patients with prior exposure to amiodarone and previous coronary bypass surgery had higher defibrillation thresholds at implantation. Two perioperative deaths occurred. There were no infections. Long-term follow-up yielded a 1- and 5-year survival of 0.88 and 0.58. respectively. and a freedom from sudden cardiac death of 1.0 and 0.97. respectively. The nonthoracotomy. left subcostal surgical approach is safe and effective. provides adequate defibrillation thresholds in most patients. and yields long-term survival comparable to other implantation techniques.',\n",

       " '4, An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs. Effects of phenacetin and salicylate on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (1968 to 1987), BACKGROUND. Phenacetin abuse is known to produce kidney disease; salicylate use is supposed to prevent cardiovascular disease. We conducted a prospective. longitudinal epidemiologic study to examine the effects of these drugs on cause-specific mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity. METHODS. In 1968 we evaluated a study group of 623 healthy women 30 to 49 years old who had evidence of a regular intake of phenacetin. as measured by urinary excretion of its metabolites. and a matched control group of 621 women. Salicylate excretion was also measured. All subjects were examined over a period of 20 years. RESULTS. Life-table analyses of mortality during the 20 years. with adjustment for the year of birth. cigarette smoking. and length of follow-up. revealed significant differences between the groups in overall mortality (study group vs. control group. 74 vs. 27 deaths; relative risk. 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval. 1.5 to 3.3). deaths due to urologic or renal disease (relative risk. 16.1; 95 percent confidence interval. 3.9 to 66.1). deaths due to cancer (relative risk. 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval. 1.1 to 3.3). and deaths due to cardiovascular disease (relative risk. 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval. 1.5 to 5.5). The relative risk of cardiovascular disease (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction. heart failure. or stroke) was 1.8. and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6. The odds ratio for the incidence of hypertension was 1.6. and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.2 to 2.1. The effects of phenacetin on morbidity and mortality. with adjustment for base-line salicylate excretion. were similar. In contrast. salicylate use had no effect on either mortality or morbidity. CONCLUSIONS. Regular use of analgesic drugs containing phenacetin is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease. as well as an increased risk of mortality due to cancer and urologic or renal disease. The use of salicylates carries no such risk.',\n",

No association was found between abnormal flow velocity waveforms and cord complications. meconium-stained amniotic fluid. or abnormal fetal heart rate tracing. nor was there any association with operative delivery for fetal distress or low Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Small for gestational age fetuses had significantly more abnormal flow velocity waveforms than appropriate for gestational age fetuses. and so had those with umbilical artery acidemia compared with those with normal pH.

This will allow different and more effective targeted responses to factors identified locally. Critical impetus will be gained with The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists leading the effort from the private medical sector in partnership with national. state. and local public health agencies and other national medical societies.',\n",
       " '10, Developmental dyslexia in women: neuropathological findings in three patients, Brains from male cases with dyslexia show symmetry of the planum temporale and predominantly left-sided cerebrocortical microdysgenesis. We now report on three women with dyslexia. In all brains. the planum temporale was again symmetrical. Also. in two of the brains. multiple foci of cerebrocortical glial scarring were present. In both women. many of the scars were myelinated. suggesting origination during late intrauterine or early postnatal life. In one. scars were mainly left perisylvian and involved portions of the vascular border zone of the temporal cortex. In the other. scars were more numerous and occurred in the border zone of the anterior. middle. and posterior cerebral arteries symmetrically. All three cases showed to a variable extent brain warts. molecular layer ectopias. and focal architectonic dysplasia identical to those seen in the male cases. Two women had primary brain neoplasms. an oligodendroglioma and a low-grade astrocytoma. respectively. and two women showed small angiomas. Reexamination of previously reported male cases disclosed one with myelinated glial scars. Two control brains with asymmetrical plana temporale showed myelinated glial scars as well. The significance of the anatomical findings is discussed. and possible etiological factors are considered with known effects of autoimmune diseases on the nervous system.',\n",
       " '23, Babies born before arrival at hospital, OBJECTIVE--To establish the prevalence of babies born before arrival at two local hospitals. To identify women at risk of giving birth before arrival. and the morbidity and mortality associated with such births. DESIGN--A case control study. Each baby born before arrival and its mother were compared with the next born in the hospital (random control). and one matched for gestation and birthweight. together with their mothers. SETTING--Two maternity units serving East Birmingham and Solihull. SUBJECTS--All babies (and their mothers) born before arrival at these hospitals from January 1983 to December 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Perinatal mortality rates. patterns of perinatal morbidity. demographic. social and obstetric features of the mothers. RESULTS--137 (0.44%) of 31.140 consecutive births were before arrival at hospital (BBA group). The perinatal mortality rate in the BBA group was 58.4/1000 (8 deaths) compared with 10.1/1000 for all inborn babies (relative risk 5.8. 95% confidence interval 2.9-11.4). In the BBA group the mean birthweight of 3008 g was 212 g (95% CI 50-374 g) less than that in the random control group; the mean gestation of 266 days was 10 days less (95% CI 5.9-14.1 days) than in the random control group. Hypothermia was the commonest morbidity. Women delivered before arrival tended to be either multigravid inner city Asians living a long way from the hospital or unmarried unbooked younger white Europeans. CONCLUSIONS--The high perinatal mortality was related to immaturity and low birthweight. rather than to birth before arrival itself. Although groups of mothers at risk of delivery before arrival can be identified more information is needed to establish whether additional antenatal care would be beneficial for these women and their babies.',\n",
       " '19, Smoking during pregnancy: a significant cause of neonatal thyroid enlargement, The influence of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the function and the echographic volume of the neonatal thyroid gland was examined in an area of borderline iodine intake (median maternal urinary iodine: 315 range 79-1558 nmol/l). There was a positive correlation (P less than 0.001) between cord serum thiocyanate (SCN) concentrations used as an index of maternal smoking and the maternal smoking habits. The thyroid volume/birthweight ratio increased significantly as a function of SCN values (P less than 0.005): this increase was secondary to a decrease in birthweight as well as to an increase in thyroid volume. There was also a positive correlation between cord serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and SCN levels (P = 0.001). Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) values remained within the normal range for age in all newborn infants and were not significantly correlated with SCN values. These results show that smoking during pregnancy in areas with borderline iodine intake may be a significant cause of thyroid enlargement in the newborn.',\n",
       " '18, Endotoxin and lipid peroxidation in vitro in selenium- and vitamin E-deficient and -adequate rat tissues, The effect of Salmonella typhimurium endotoxin injected intraperitoneally into rats (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) on subsequent lipid peroxidation in vitro was assessed. Peroxidation was monitored by measuring ethane production from tissue slices. as well as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and conjugated dienes in tissue homogenates. Weanling rats were fed a selenium- and vitamin E-deficient basal diet or one supplemented with 0.2 mg of Se/kg of diet and 200 mg of vitamin E/kg. After 9 to 16 wk. ethane production and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in liver and lung generally were increased by LPS treatment of Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats. Conjugated dienes were increased by LPS treatment in liver of Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats. but paradoxically. were higher in Se- and vitamin E-adequate liver tissue. Daily injections of 1 g of hydroxyurea/kg of body weight. a cell proliferation inhibitor. for 2 d prior to LPS injection significantly decreased the LPS-induced ethane production in Se- and vitamin E-deficient rat liver and lung. These results show that low doses of LPS injected into rats stimulated lipid peroxidation in vitro in Se- and vitamin E-deficient rat liver tissue. Hydroxyurea decreased LPS-induced lipid peroxidation in vitro; this suggests that neutrophils or macrophages are involved in LPS-induced lipid peroxidation.',\n",
       " '10, Deficiency of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in a patient with facioscapulohumeral disease, Facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD). an inherited neuromuscular disorder. is characterized by progressive wasting of specific muscle groups. particularly the proximal musculature of the upper limbs; the primary defect in this disorder is unknown. We studied a patient with FSHD to determine whether the mitochondrial respiratory chain was functionally abnormal. Muscle biopsy revealed fiber atrophy with patchy staining for oxidative enzymes. Electron microscopy of a liver section showed many enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions. Decreased oxidation of the respiratory substrates-alanine and succinate-in skin fibroblasts suggested a deficiency of complex III of the electron-transport chain; cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV) was in the normal range. Biochemical analysis of liver supported the fibroblast data. since succinate oxidase activity (electron-transport activity through complexes II-IV) was reduced. whereas complex IV activity was normal. Furthermore. analysis of the cytochrome spectrum in liver revealed typical peaks for cytochromes cc1 and aa3. whereas cytochrome b (a component of complex III) was undetectable. Southern blot analysis of fibroblast mtDNA revealed no major deletions or rearrangements. Our study provides the first documentation of a specific enzyme-complex deficiency associated with FSHD.',\n",

DUEC was used as a screening test in 100 women attending the urodynamic clinic with incontinence and in the 33 women who voided over 250 ml. the findings correlated well with subsequent urodynamic diagnosis of urethral sphincter incompetence and detrusor instability.',\n",
       " '18, Cross-sectional analysis of renal function in black Americans with NIDDM, Our objective was to define glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) in Black Americans with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This was a cross-sectional study of 71 Black NIDDM patients with diagnosed diabetes duration from 1 mo to 21 yr. Hyperglycemia was regulated and stabilized before patients were entered into the study. GFR and RPF were determined by the clearance of [125I]iothalamate and 131I-labeled hippuran. respectively. with a constant-infusion technique and four urine collection periods. Hyperfiltration. as defined by a GFR of greater than 140 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2. was found in 7 of 20 patients (35%) with newly diagnosed (less than 2 yr duration) NIDDM. The percentage of patients with hyperfiltration decreased with increasing duration of diagnosed diabetes. Decreasing GFR and RPF occurred with increasing duration of diagnosed diabetes. In conclusion. renal hemodynamic changes in Black Americans with NIDDM are similar to those known to occur in White populations with IDDM.',\n",
       " '4, Helicobacter pylori and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is almost invariably associated with chronic duodenal ulcer disease. The relationship between H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is unknown. We investigated the frequency of H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and also what effect H. pylori infection had on gastric function in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection was diagnosed based on a specific serologic (ELISA) assay based on high-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins of H. pylori. We studied 20 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; 15 men and 5 women ranging in age from 24 to 71 years. median age 51. Six Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients had H. pylori infection compared to 100 consecutive patients with chronic recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients ranged from 7.9 to 95.0 mmol/hr. median 35.2. Pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output ranged from 8.5 to 132 mmol/hr; median 52.7. Acid secretion was lower in the H. pylori-infected patients than the uninfected patients (BAO 24.5 +/- 6.5 vs 45.4 +/- 6.6. and MAO 44.3 +/- 11.8 vs 67.9 +/- 10.7. for H. pylori infected vs uninfected patients. respectively). The difference in BAO was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The present results indicate that H. pylori is not a major contributing factor in duodenal ulcer associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The association of a reduced BAO with H. pylori suggests that these findings may be related.',\n",
       " '4, Peptic ulcer perforation as the presentation of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, We examined the characteristics of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who developed a perforation prior to diagnosis to determine whether any clinical features were useful markers of the syndrome. Of 160 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. perforation occurred prior to the diagnosis being made in 11 (7%). At surgery. perforations were found in the duodenum in six cases and in the jejunum in five. In no case was tumor identified at emergency surgery. and the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome was made only in the postoperative period when excessive gastric secretions were noted. Neither acid output nor serum gastrin concentration were useful predictors for perforation. The patients. six men and five women. were 27-61 years old (median 48) and one had MEN-1. Three patients had no symptoms prior to the perforation. The other eight had symptoms for 1-15 years. with diarrhea occurring in 45% of the cases. Following the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. patients were given medication to control gastric acid hypersecretion. Eight patients remained well. but the three patients who had had a partial gastrectomy had a complicated course despite medical therapy. Although features of perforation in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are not specific. jejunal perforation or perforation associated with a history of diarrhea is suggestive of the diagnosis. Serum gastrin should be measured in every case and a partial gastrectomy avoided.',\n",
       " '10, Denervation in hemiplegic muscles, This study examined the frequency of denervation activity in hemiplegic muscles in relation to the size and location of the central lesion. We studied 20 patients. 14 with major unilateral cerebral infarctions in the middle cerebral or internal carotid territories; four with a single lacune in the pons. internal capsule. or thalamus; and two with precentral infarcts. Using somatosensory evoked potentials. motor conduction studies. and assessments of conduction across the plexus and roots. we detected no conduction abnormalities on the affected side. Fibrillation was common in both groups. especially in distal and intermediate muscles. The distribution of the fibrillation and the normal conduction studies suggested that trauma of peripheral nerves was not a factor. Although the normal conduction studies and pattern of fibrillation activity do not exclude peripheral nerve trauma as the cause of the fibrillation. we suggest that transsynaptic degeneration is a reasonable alternative explanation.',\n",
       " '1, Diagnosis of Campylobacter pylori gastritis, Campylobacter pylori is a bacterium that inhabits gastric mucosa. It causes chronic active gastritis and is highly associated with duodenal ulcer. Campylobacter pylori has a urease enzyme (not present in man). which allows diagnosis by a [14C]urea breath test. We compared two noninvasive tests. the breath test and serum ELISA. to biopsy and histologic diagnosis. Twenty-two patients who underwent gastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of possible peptic ulcer disease entered the study. The breath test detected the organism in eight of eight patients biopsy-positive for the organism (sensitivity 100%). The breath test was negative in 12 of the 14 patients who were biopsy-negative (specificity 86%). The ELISA was performed in 14 patients. It was positive in 5 of 5 patients biopsy-positive for the organism (sensitivity 100%) and negative in 7 of 9 patients who were biopsy-negative (specificity 78%). We conclude that both the ELISA and the [14C]urea breath test are excellent noninvasive methods to detect Campylobacter pylori. However. only the breath test is suitable for following the response to treatment. as it detects the presence of the organism rather than an immune response to it.',\n",
       " '5, Acute eosinophilic pulmonary disease associated with the ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products, A series of four patients with pulmonary infiltrates. pleural effusions. hypoxemia. peripheral eosinophilia. and symptoms of dyspnea. fatigue. and weakness is reported. Lung tissue obtained in three patients revealed interstitial pneumonitis. small-to-medium-vessel mixed-cell vasculitis. and alveolar exudate of histiocytes and eosinophils. All patients reported ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products at a time when an association between L-tryptophan and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was established. This clinical pattern of pulmonary involvement may be part of the continuum of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The pathophysiology of this syndrome and the relationship with the ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products have not yet been identified.',\n",
       " '1, The diagnostic utility of the antibody-coated bacteria test in intubated patients, PURPOSE: Pilot study to determine if the presence of antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) in sputum specimens obtained from endotracheal tube suctioning would aid in the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated patients for a two-month period were recruited for study. The diagnosis of LRTI was based on a clinical suspicion sufficient enough to start or change antibiotic therapy. Specimens were obtained by blind endotracheal tube suctioning. After processing. sputum smears were stained with fluorescein-labelled antibody to the Fc portion of IgG. IgM. and IgA. More than five fluorescein-labelled bacteria per oil immersion field were considered positive smears. RESULTS: Seventy-one specimens were obtained from 36 patients. Eighteen specimens were positive in 12 patients. all of whom had LRTI. No specimen was positive in patients not diagnosed as having LRTI. The ACB test was positive in 12 of 25 patients with LRTI. Patients with LRTI but negative ACB were more likely to have received prior antibiotic therapy (p less than 0.001). ACB was positive prior to the clinical diagnosis of LRTI in seven of nine patients (av 4.1 days. range 2-6 days) and converted to negative in three specimens obtained seven or more days after starting appropriate antibiotics. while in three specimens it remained positive three-six days post treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: The ACB test appears to be highly specific for the presence of LRTI in intubated patients. Sensitivity of the test may be adversely affected by prior antibiotic therapy. A positive ACB test may predict the subsequent development of LRTI. Further study is warranted.',\n",
       " '6, Primary cytomegalovirus infection and gastric ulcers in normal host, A 42-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain and vomiting. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed three gastric ulcers. Histologic examination of biopsies from the ulcers showed cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies. The appearance of IgM antibodies to cytomegalovirus indicated a recent and primary infection. Stored serum from her last pregnancy 17 months previously contained no cytomegalovirus antibodies. A thorough evaluation of her immune system revealed no abnormality. We are aware of only two other cases where seroconversion was documented in normal hosts. Cytomegalovirus infections in the gastrointestinal tract of normal hosts are very unusual but a common cause of morbidity in immunocompromised hosts. We believe that cytomegalovirus may have a role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal lesions in nonimmunocompromised patients.',\n",
       " '18, Cellular immunodeficiency in protein-losing enteropathy. Predominant reduction of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes, Cellular immunological abnormalities were studied in a patient with protein-losing enteropathy associated with constrictive pericarditis. Analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood showed lymphopenia with a decrease of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells. whereas CD8+ lymphocytes. B cells and NK cells were within the normal range. Fecal loss of lymphocytes as a cause of lymphopenia was evidenced by a marked excretion of 111-indium-labeled peripheral blood mononuclear cells via stool. Proliferative responses against several mitogens were severely reduced as was in vitro IgG production. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction against a variety of antigens was absent. Vaccination with tick-borne encephalitis virus. used for primary immunization. and with the recall antigen tetanus toxoid resulted in a blunted antibody response. After pericardectomy. the severity of enteric protein loss declined. serum immunoglobulin levels returned to the normal range. and total lymphocytes and CD3+ and CD4+ counts increased but remained low even 12 months after surgery. Fecal loss of lymphocytes was found to be reduced after pericardectomy. but was higher than that seen in a disease control patient with active inflammatory bowel disease. In vitro immunoglobulin production returned to normal. DTH could be demonstrated against purified protein derivative and proteus antigen. but mitogen-driven blastogenic response of lymphocytes remained low. Revaccination with tick-borne encephalitis and tetanus toxoid antigens seven months after surgery resulted in a dramatic increase of serum levels of antibodies against both antigens. comparable to that seen in healthy control individuals.',\n",
       " '4, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Relation to Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis and gastric acid secretion, Since Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa in most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer. infection with this organism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this common disease. We postulated that if H. pylori is pathogenic in the usual type of duodenal ulcer. it should be less common when duodenal ulcer has another. specific etiology. such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastric mucosa was compared from 18 patients with proven Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (17 of whom had had duodenal ulcer disease) and 18 controls with chronic duodenal ulcer without such a diagnosis. All subjects. who were matched for age and sex. had undergone elective gastric resections. Gastric tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were reviewed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. The frequency of H. pylori in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (8/18) was lower than in controls with duodenal ulcer (16/18; P less than 0.02). Moreover. chronic antral gastritis scores were higher in patients with duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.01). In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. peak acid output was lower in patients positive (median 22 meq/30 min) compared to those negative for H. pylori (median 32 meq/30 min; P less than 0.02) but serum gastrin was correspondingly lower in patients positive for H. pylori (P less than 0.05). H. pylori infection appears to be more frequent when duodenal ulceration is not associated with another etiology. such as acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may also be associated with decreased gastric acid secretion.',\n",
       " \"10, Natural history of progressive ischemic stroke in a population treated with heparin, Data on the acute natural history of progressive stroke with or without heparin treatment are limited. To define the acute course of patients treated with heparin for progressive stroke. we examined the charts of 69 such patients identified through the Cornell Neurology Database from October 1979 to June 1985. Analysis included determining whether further clinical deterioration or hemorrhagic complications were associated with readily identifiable clinical or laboratory variables. Twenty-five patients (36%) continued to deteriorate while receiving heparin. another two (3%) worsened due to intracerebral hemorrhage. and a total of 10 patients (14%) had bleeding complications. No clinical features or heparin dosing regimens distinguished the patients likely to benefit from heparin. Clinical progression or hemorrhage did not correlate with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the average heparin dose per day or the mean partial thromboplastin time. Without unequivocal evidence demonstrating heparin's ineffectiveness for progressive stroke. many clinicians managing such patients will continue to use heparin. Our results suggest that this decision should not be governed by such clinical features as a patient's age or sex or by the vascular distribution of the stroke. Furthermore. frequent measurement of and overzealous efforts to adjust the partial thromboplastin time may be unnecessary since it does not correlate with outcome.\",\n",
       " '5, Mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (Namaqualand type): genetic linkage to the type II collagen gene COL2A1, Namaqualand spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (NSED) is a mild autosomal dominant form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia in which changes are maximal in the femoral capital epiphyses and the vertebral bodies. The condition is present in a large multigeneration South African family. and it is clinically important by virtue of severe progressive degenerative osteoarthropathy of the hip joint. which frequently necessitates prosthetic joint replacement in adulthood. Linkage studies using molecular markers have shown that the loci for the NSED and type II collagen genes are linked (LOD score 7.98 at a recombination fraction of .00).',\n",
       " '14, Arginine vasopressin gene expression in chronic cardiac failure in rats, Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is known to be increased in patients and experimental animals with chronic cardiac failure (CCF). The importance of an increase in biosynthesis of AVP in the hypothalamus has. however. not heretofore been investigated and is the purpose of the present study. CCF secondary to infarction of myocardial tissue was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and sham operated animals served as controls. Four weeks later hypothalamic AVP mRNA was determined by solution hybridization using sense and anti-sense strand RNA. The blood pressure was lower in CCF than sham animals (131.2 +/- 3.1 vs. 112.8 +/- 4.0 mm Hg. P less than 0.05) and the total heart. and right and left ventricle weights were significantly higher in CCF rats. Plasma AVP was higher in CCF (sham 6.78 +/- 0.30; CCF 11.46 +/- 0.64 pg/ml. P less than 0.001) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was also higher in CCF than sham animals (205 +/- 36 vs. 554 +/- 56 pg/ml. P less than 0.001). The AVP mRNA in hypothalamus was significantly higher in CCF than sham animals (55.5 +/- 3.7 vs. 95.9 +/- 4.0 pg/micrograms total RNA. P less than 0.001). There was no difference in beta-actin mRNA in the hypothalamus of sham and CCF rats. indicating that the AVP-mRNA increase was specific in CCF. These results therefore demonstrate that increased AVP biosynthesis in the hypothalamus. in addition to release of the hormone from the posterior pituitary. may occur in CCF.',\n",
       " '21, Fibrinogen degradation product-D, fibrinogen, and serum change polymorphonuclear granulocyte activity--possibly important post-trauma, Severe trauma favors the susceptibility of patients to infection. It has been shown that proteins or protein fragments are responsible for an endogenous immunodepression. After trauma a coagulopathy accompanied by increased serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) is often found. Therefore. we examined whether FDP-D can influence the activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). PMN-activation was measured by two different superoxide-specific methods (Cytochrome-C-test. INT-test). With both methods we found a decrease of PMN activity by FDP-D compared to fibrinogen. Albumin. which was used as a control protein. only influenced PMN activity in unphysiologically high concentrations. The third method used to quantify PMN activity was chemiluminescence. which is a more unspecific method since it is developed not only by oxygen radical species but also by activating the lipoxygenase pathway. In contrast to the superoxide specific tests we found an inhibitory effect of fibrinogen and also serum compared to FDP-D using chemiluminescence.',\n",
       " '21, Improvement of septic syndrome after administration of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), Twenty patients with generalized sepsis were studied prospectively to evaluate the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) administration. Five patients had developed sepsis after major abdominal surgery. 15 patients after multiple trauma with head injury (HTI-ISS 38 +/- 2 and Glasgow Coma Scale 4 +/- 1). The urea production rate (UPR) could be significantly reduced by the intramuscular administration of 1.5 IU of rhGH/kg bodyweight (BW) per day (UPR day: 5. 62 +/- 6.7 gm/d vs. UPR day: 10. 42.6 +/- 5.9 gm/d). The catabolic index of Bistrian (BI) was significantly lower after rhGH therapy on day 10 compared to day 5. IGF-1 increased significantly after the administration of rhGH. The nitrogen balance. however. did not become positive. despite the administration of rhGH. The changes in sepsis were estimated by the scoring system according to Elebute and Stoner on days 3. 5. 7. 10. and 13. In those patients who were available for post-treatment evaluation the parameters had returned to baseline values after the withdrawal of rhGH. Results indicate that this therapy might ameliorate the nitrogen intake. but has no influence on the course of sepsis. Compared to previously published results in nonseptic patients. the somatomedin inhibitors as well as the split-products of the complement system and the metabolites of arachidonic acid may have been responsible for this weak effect of rhGH and IGF-1 in septicemia.',\n",
       " '21, Delayed union of fibular fractures accompanying fractures of the tibial shaft, Among 440 adult patients with tibial shaft fracture and accompanying fibular fracture there were eight cases with radiographically ununited fibulae 4 months after the injury. each with uneventful tibial union. Fractures with severe soft-tissue injuries were excluded from this study. In 293 patients the treatment method of the tibial fracture was conservative. comprising closed reduction and immobilization by long plaster cast. In 147 patients it was intramedullary Kuntscher nailing. and all the eight cases with delayed fibular union occurred among these. the frequency being 5.4%. The typical accompanying fibular fracture to develop delayed union was a comminuted one in the middle or distal third of the bone. At a followup examination 5 to 8 years after the original injury four of the eight fractures were found to have ultimately spontaneously united. while three showed a radiographically indisputable nonunion. One patient had undergone segmental fibular ostectomy because of persistent local pain but in the remaining patients the subjective symptoms were negligible. The occurrence of delayed fibular union in association with rigid intramedullary nailing of concomitant tibial shaft fracture is a phenomenon of which trauma surgeons should be aware even if the natural course of the condition often seems to be benign.',\n",
       " '23, Techniques of emergency ventilation: a model to evaluate tidal volume, airway pressure, and gastric insufflation, We designed a model to evaluate the effectiveness of various noninvasive methods of ventilation. The upper airway was simulated with the head of a Resusci-Annie which was attached to a test lung. The esophagus and stomach were simulated with a Penrose drain connected to a rolling seal spirometer via a PEEP valve. Fifteen paramedic volunteers ventilated the model utilizing mouth-to-mouth. mouth-to-mask. bag-valve-mask. or portable field ventilator (Impact or HARV). Recording of tidal volume. gastric volume. and proximal and distal airway pressure was completed at three different levels of compliance. At normal compliance. all methods except the HARV met or exceeded American Heart Association standards. As compliance decreased. tidal volume fell and gastric insufflation increased. At a compliance of 0.02 L/cm H2O all methods failed to meet AHA standards and gastric insufflation volume equalled delivered tidal volumes for mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques. Mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques generated the largest tidal volumes but also created the largest volume of gastric insufflation. The Impact ventilator provided an acceptable tidal volume with minimal gastric insufflation. Our results suggest that mouth-to-mask ventilation with supplemental oxygen enrichment is the most efficient technique for non-invasive airway management.',\n",
       " '18, Nephron site responsible for the reduced kaliuretic response to mineralocorticoids during hypokalemia in rats, Rats with hypokalemia induced by eating a low-K diet have a diminished kaliuretic response to mineralocorticoids. The purpose of this study was to determine if this was the due to a lower rate of net secretion of K in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) and/or an enhanced rate of reabsorption of K in the medullary collecting duct (MCD). Secondary active secretion of K in the CCD raises the [K] in the lumen as compared to the plasma [TF/P)K). If the (TF/P)K is greater than 1. there was secondary active secretion of K in this nephron segment. The (TF/P)K in the CCD was measured by microcatheterization of the collecting duct. Three groups of rats were studied: rats on a low-K diet with and without the acute administration of DOCA. and rats on a normal-K diet treated with DOCA on a chronic basis. Rats on the low-K diet had a (TF/P)K of 0.8 +/- 0.11; this value did not rise to values significantly greater than 1 after the acute administration of DOCA (1.4 +/- 0.35). In contrast. chronic administration of DOCA to rats fed a normal-K diet did result in a (TF/P)K which was significantly greater than unity (3.1 +/- 0.39). The degree of hypokalemia was not significantly different in these rats. The absolute and fractional reabsorption of K in the MCD was not different in the rats on the low-K diet with or without DOCA. We conclude that the nephron segment which is responsible for the reduced kaliuretic response to mineralocorticoids is the CCD.',\n",
       " '10, A follow-up study of intractable seizures in childhood, One hundred forty-five children with seizures that were refractory to medical therapy for at least 2 years were followed 5 to 20 years after onset. The majority of children with uncontrollable seizures (61%) were mentally retarded. and most of these (73%) had onset of seizures at younger than 2 years of age. Age of onset was significantly later (mean 5.0 +/- 0.5 yr [SEM]) in the group of children with borderline to normal intelligence. Follow-up data showed remission of seizures in a significant proportion of children with borderline or normal intelligence. with a linear decrease of the percentage with persistent seizures at a rate of about 4% per year. Remission of seizures was much less frequent (1.5%/yr) in the group with mental retardation. Seizure type had some effects on outcome. Children with focal atrophic brain lesions did no worse than those without definable pathology on brain-imaging studies.',\n",
       " '10, Headache: a marker of depression, Patients who presented with a chief complaint of headache in the outpatient family practice setting were found to have a high prevalence of depression (63%) by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) index. A statistically significant relationship was found between the frequency of headaches (P = .03) with level of depression. In fact. 74% of patients with headaches recurring almost every day had a clinically significant depression diagnosed as defined by the Zung SDS score. The Zung SDS score also correlated with the length of time that the problem of headache existed (P less than .05). Item analysis of the individual 20-item depression score revealed that four questions accounted for 93% of the variance. This analysis suggests that shorter. more abbreviated screening questions could be developed and refined in the future for use by the busy clinician. Headache is an important marker for depression in the primary care setting. It can be inferred from this study that the clinician may need to focus more on treating the entity of depression than on treating just the symptom of headache.',\n",
       " '10, Brain pH in head injury: an image-guided 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy study, It has been suggested that brain acidosis may follow head trauma. and therapies aimed at correcting acidosis have been proposed. Direct measurements of intracellular pH. however. have thus far not been possible in clinical situations. We have studied the intracellular brain pH in 22 patients after head injury (mean Glasgow Coma Score 6.1). Patients were investigated by a combined approach of phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (overall examination time 50-75 min) at a mean time of 11 days after injury (36 hours to 24 days). 31P spectra were obtained in 11 patients on assisted ventilation and in 11 patients on spontaneous ventilation. These spectra were analyzed to yield the pH in the regions studied in all the patients. All pH values were in the normal or alkalotic range when compared with 6 age-matched normal controls. No differences were found between patients on assisted ventilation and patients on spontaneous ventilation. When analyzed as a group. the brain pH in the focal lesions appeared to increase in the first days. to reach a peak in the alkalotic range in the second week. and to return toward normal within 3 weeks from acute injury. Our results suggest that there is no evidence of posttraumatic intracellular brain acidosis in recent human head injury. and therefore. therapies aimed at alkalinizing brain cells need to be reconsidered.',\n",

The data were obtained. by means of a magnetic search coil technique. prior to and 1 week after injection of botulinum toxin into the orbicularis oculi muscle. Before treatment. the peak velocity of blink-related lid lowering and lid raising was slower than normal. yet lid saccades were normal. After botulinum treatment. significant decreases occurred in (1) the amplitude of blinks and lid saccades. and (2) the peak velocity of the blink down-phase. Botulinum treatment significantly alters blink lid-lowering kinematics. while saccadic lid-lowering kinematics are normal. providing further evidence that the orbicularis oculi muscle does not play a primary role in downward lid saccades.\",\n",
       " '14, Noninvasive detection of occlusive disease of the carotid siphon and middle cerebral artery, Recently. transcranial Doppler sonography has been introduced into clinical practice for noninvasive investigation of the large intracranial arteries. To determine its accuracy for detection of stenosing or occluding lesions. 133 consecutive patients were studied by both transcranial Doppler sonography and selective cerebral arteriography. Statistical analysis of findings was done separately for various arterial segments. High values for sensitivity and specificity were found for detecting obstruction of the carotid siphon and main stem of the middle cerebral artery. Diagnostic reliability of transcranial Doppler sonography was also confirmed by the calculation of a chance-corrected measure of agreement (kappa). which was close to + 1 in all subanalyses. Transcranial Doppler sonography seems to be a valuable tool for noninvasive detection of intracranial lesions of the middle cerebral artery and carotid siphon.',\n",
       " '20, Elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in patients with active multiple sclerosis, The level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was quantitated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 24 patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 patients with other neurological disorders in whom immunological mechanisms are unlikely to participate. The sIL-2R level in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis in relapse was significantly higher compared with patients with multiple sclerosis in remission and with controls. The sIL-2R level. especially in the cerebrospinal fluid. showed higher sensitivity and specificity than other clinical parameters including the cerebrospinal fluid IgG ratio. peripheral lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio. cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein and oligoclonal bands. Our data suggest that measurement of the sIL-2R level may be useful in evaluating disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis.',\n",
       " '10, Magnetic motor-evoked potentials in epilepsy: effects of the disease and of anticonvulsant medication, Magnetic motor-evoked potentials were recorded in 53 patients with medically intractable. mainly temporal lobe epilepsy and compared with potentials of 110 healthy volunteers. The motor-evoked potentials were reevaluated in 16 of the 53 patients after substantial reduction of antiepileptic drug doses. The objective was to assess the effect of epilepsy and of anticonvulsant medication on the central motor system. In subjects receiving antiepileptic treatment. cortical threshold intensities were markedly elevated and peripheral latencies were prolonged. Cortical threshold intensities and peripheral latencies decreased to approach control values after anticonvulsant medication was reduced but were increased in patients treated with 2 or 3 anticonvulsant agents instead of 1. Additionally. high levels of interictal epileptiform activity and a high frequency of seizures significantly decreased the central motor conduction time and. in part. threshold intensities. The central motor conduction time was further diminished after reduction of anticonvulsant treatment and increased when several drugs were administered. The duration of epilepsy. the location of the epileptic focus. and the type of the epileptic seizure did not affect motor-evoked potentials. Conclusively. central motor pathways are endogenously facilitated by epileptiform activity even if clinical signs of their involvement are absent. Anticonvulsant medication exerts major reversible effects on magnetic motor-evoked potentials.',\n",

Localization of calcium and albumin. as endogenous markers of extracellular fluid penetration. showed the presence of both molecules inside some fibers lacking dystrophin. Our morphological studies show that the initial stages leading to fiber necrosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy are present in carriers with mosaicism. Comparison of dystrophin studies with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and creatine kinase levels showed that neither immunocytochemical nor immunoblot techniques for dystrophin are sensitive enough to provide a basis for genetic counseling.',\n",
       " \"10, Respiratory failure and unilateral caudal brainstem infarction, We report clinicotopographic correlations in 2 patients with central hypoventilation and unilateral infarct in the caudal brainstem. One patient had nearly complete loss of ventilation involving both automatic and voluntary components. He showed no ventilator response during a CO2 retention test (PaCO2 62 mm Hg. PaO2 82 mm Hg). while consciousness was preserved until death. The infarct involved the reticular formation. nucleus tractus solitarius. nucleus ambiguus. and nucleus retroambiguus on the right but spared the dorsal motor nucleus of the tenth cranial nerve. and sensory and corticospinal tracts. The second patient showed hypoventilation more selectively involving automatic responses (Ondine's curse). The infarct involved the medullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus but spared the nucleus tractus solitarius. We suggest that unilateral involvement of pontomedullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus is sufficient for generating loss of automatic respiration. while associated lesion of the nucleus tractus solitarius may lead to more severe respiratory failure involving both automatic and voluntary responses.\",\n",
       " '4, The clinical pharmacology of etoposide, Etoposide. a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin. is increasingly used to treat cancer. Etoposide is a phase-specific. cytotoxic drug acting in the late S and early G2 phases of the cell cycle. It appears to cause breaks in DNA by either an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals. Most studies show a biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide. The peak plasma concentrations of drug and the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) are linearly related to the IV dose. Considerable interpatient variability of pharmacokinetic variables exists after IV etoposide. Various metabolites of etoposide have been identified. but their detection and quantitation are disputed. Approximately 30% to 70% of an etoposide dose is excreted. The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%. but its absorption is not linear with increasing doses within the range in clinical use. Considerable interpatient and intrapatient variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of oral etoposide. There is no evidence of etoposide accumulation after multiple consecutive doses by either the IV or oral route. The exact roles of the liver and kidney in metabolism and excretion of etoposide are uncertain. Etoposide has been shown to be a highly schedule-dependent drug in clinical studies. This. together with the phase-specific action of etoposide and its increasingly widespread use in treating cancer. makes the clinical pharmacology of this drug of great clinical importance.',\n",
       " '4, The role of etoposide in the treatment of poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site, Patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC) or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (PDA) of unknown primary site comprise 25% to 35% of the patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site. Some of these patients have neoplasms that are highly responsive to combination chemotherapy. and a minority have potentially curable tumors. Between 1978 and 1982. 68 patients were treated with combination chemotherapy (most received cisplatin. vinblastine. and bleomycin [PVB] with or without doxorubicin). Thirty-eight patients (56%) responded to treatment. with 15 (22%) complete responder (CR) and 9 (13%) long-term. disease-free survivors. Since that time. we have incorporated etoposide into the treatment of these patients because of its synergism with cisplatin and its great activity against several other neoplasms. including germ cell tumors. Seventeen patients with PDC of unknown primary site received salvage therapy with etoposide and cisplatin after failing PVB. Ten of these patients had partial responses (PR). with a median response duration of 5 months (range. 2 to 12 months). Thirty-two previously untreated patients with PDC received etoposide and cisplatin combinations as initial treatment. Eighteen of 30 evaluable patients (60%) responded to therapy. and 11 patients (37%) had CR. Seven patients remain disease-free 39 to 63 months after the completion of therapy. Etoposide is an active drug in the treatment of PDC of unknown primary site. Preliminary results indicate that initial treatment with etoposide and cisplatin combinations produces results equivalent to or superior to those achieved with PVB.',\n",
       " '4, Future directions for etoposide therapy, Etoposide is an important chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of selected patients with germ cell tumors. lymphomas. and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Its optimal use is continuing to evolve. It is clear that schedule dependency is of critical importance. Recently. preliminary studies have suggested that a prolonged schedule of etoposide administration (21 days) may be more effective than the standard 3- to 5-day schedule. Results of several Phase II studies show chronic oral etoposide administration induces occasional responses in resistant tumors and higher-than-expected response rates in patients with germ cell tumors and SCLC. Preliminary data show nearly 90% etoposide absorption when given in a low-dose schedule (50 mg/m2/d) for 21 days. These observations indicate that etoposide may be a \"new drug\" when given in the chronic schedule. Further exploration of the schedule dependency of etoposide is indicated. Etoposide has recently been proven useful in selected patients with gastric. ovarian. and poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site. Several other drugs are either synergistic or additive and will be explored in combination chemotherapy. The possibility of adding topoisomerase I inhibitors and modulating etoposide\\'s activity by inhibiting drug resistance is now within the realm of human testing.',\n",
       " '4, The pharmacology of intravenous and oral etoposide, The epipodophyllotoxin derivative etoposide (VP-16) has been in widespread use both alone and in combination chemotherapy for the past decade. It has phase-specific cytotoxicity that acts in the last S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Although its mode of action is not certain. it appears to act by causing breaks in DNA by interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or by the formation of free radicals. Most studies show biexponential decay after the intravenous (IV) administration of etoposide. Approximately 30% to 70% of administered etoposide is excreted. with approximately 45% present in the urine. Etoposide is available in oral and IV preparations. It is highly schedule-dependent. with once-daily doses (e.g.. for 5 to 8 days every 21 days) giving results superior to intermittent administration. The bioavailability of oral etoposide is approximately 50%. but its absorption is not linear with increasing dose (e.g.. greater than 200 mg/d. bioavailability decreases). Factors influencing the bioavailability of oral etoposide include patient status. concurrent medications. hepatic and renal function. and nausea and vomiting. In numerous clinical trials. etoposide has demonstrated excellent activity against a range of tumors. including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). malignant lymphomas. gestational trophoblastic tumors. Ewing\\'s and soft tissue sarcomas. and germ cell tumors. with more modest activity in other tumors (e.g.. non-SCLC). Although few comparative studies have been carried out. available data suggest that oral etoposide administered daily during 5 to 8 days is similar to the IV preparation in range of activity. In a study of 53 elderly patients with SCLC treated with etoposide (200 mg/d for five times). there was a response rate of 79% and a median survival of 9.5 months. These results were similar to those achieved with more intensive IV regimens. Several studies of chronic oral etoposide (50 mg/m2/d for 21 times) have been reported recently. Responses were observed in SCLC and germ cell tumors among patients who had relapsed after standard etoposide-containing regimens. These data suggest that etoposide may be a \"new\" drug when given in this schedule. The high response rates with oral etoposide suggest that oral administration may be substituted for IV administration. This substitution may allow for greater flexibility in chemotherapeutic administration. less hospitalization. and more acceptable toxicity.',\n",

The CDS/JHU AIDS Project Team, Of 4588 pregnant women in a high-risk Haitian population. 443 (9.7%) were serologically positive for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive were more likely to be premature. of low birth weight. and malnourished at 3 and 6 months of age than were infants born to women who were HIV-1 seronegative. Increased mortality was observed in infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive by 3 months of age. At 12 months of age. 23.4% of the infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive had died compared with 10.8% of the infants born to women who were HIV-1 seronegative; at 24 months of age. the mortality rates were 31.3% and 14.2%. respectively. Maternal HIV-1 infections resulted in an 11.7% increase in the overall infant mortality rate in this population. The estimated mother-to-infant HIV-1 transmission rate in these breast-fed infants was 25%. similar to the rates reported for non-breast-fed populations in the United States and Europe.',\n",
       " '4, Etoposide in leukemia, Etoposide (VP16-213. NSC 141540) induces a complete response (CR) in 15% to 25% of previously treated patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) when used as a single agent. Etoposide has been used successfully in combination with cytarabine. daunorubicin. and amsacrine for salvage and consolidation therapies. Previously untreated ANLL patients 15 to 70 years of age were randomly assigned to cytarabine (100 mg/m2) on days 1 to 7 plus daunorubicin (50 mg/m2) on days 1 to 3 (7-3) or to the same drugs plus etoposide (75 mg/m2) on days 1 to 7 (7-3-7). Patients achieving a CR received two consolidation courses (5-2. attenuated 7-3 or 5-2-5). Among 264 eligible patients. there was a 56% CR rate with 7-3 therapy and a 59% CR rate with 7-3-7 therapy. Remission duration was significantly improved with 7-3-7 (median. 12 months with 7-3 and 18 months with 7-3-7; P = 0.01). but survival was not. Subset analysis in patients younger than 55 years of age revealed prolonged remission (median. 12 months with 7-3 and 27 months with 7-3-7; P = 0.01) and survival (median. 9 months with 7-3 and 17 months with 7-3-7; P = 0.04) with the 7-3-7 regimen. Hematologic toxicity was similar for both regimens during induction. but significantly more severe for 7-3-7 during consolidation therapy. Etoposide is active in ANLL and prolongs remission when used in induction therapy.',\n",
       " '4, High-dose etoposide and marrow transplantation, Etoposide underwent conventional Phase I testing in the 1970s. The dose-limiting toxicity in these studies was mild myelosuppression; other toxicities were infrequent. If a greater degree of myelosuppression is accepted. higher than standard doses could be given. This approach takes advantage of the steep dose-response relationship for most chemotherapeutic agents. including etoposide. as shown in early in vitro and clinical studies. Thus. etoposide was considered an ideal agent for further dose-escalation studies. given its wide range of clinical antitumor activity at standard doses. steep dose-response curve. mild bone marrow suppression. and few nonmyeloid side effects. The high-dose etoposide studies that followed used improved and more intensive hematologic supportive care. including. in some trials. autologous marrow transplantation. When etoposide was used as a single agent in these high-dose trials. mucositis. and. to a lesser degree. hepatic dysfunction were dose-limiting. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this setting was 2.4 to 3.0 g/m2. Multi-agent Phase I trials with etoposide and cyclophosphamide. total body irradiation. carmustine. or carboplatin also resulted in dose-limiting mucosal toxicity. with liver and lung problems appearing more often than with high-dose etoposide alone. The toxicity and MTD can be influenced markedly by the schedule of administration. Etoposide as a continuous intravenous infusion can be given at doses of 4.2 g/m2 (with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide) with similar toxicity. but without marrow support. The antitumor results in the lymphomas set the stage for treatment of solid tumors. where treatment of patients with \"sensitive\" relapses had the best outcome. Lymphoma patients had an 80% response rate; overall. long-term (greater than 2 years) disease-free survival was approximately 40%. Germ cell tumors were also responsive. and the same pattern of sensitive relapses and improvement in responding patients was seen (50% to 75% of patients greater than 1 year). In breast cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). high-dose etoposide-containing regimens were used to intensify standard therapy. The results in these settings were not quite as good (breast cancer. 30% disease-free survival at 2 years; SCLC. 10% at 2 years).',\n",
       " '14, Role of basic fibroblast growth factor in vascular lesion formation, In the present study we investigated whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays a role in the proliferative response of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to denuding injury. Rat carotid smooth muscle was found to express the mRNA for bFGF. and bFGF protein was found to be present in rat aorta by immunoblot analysis. Systemically administered bFGF was a potent mitogen for vascular SMCs in arteries denuded with a balloon catheter. increasing replication from 11.5% in controls to 54.8%. Denudation with a device (filament loop). which causes only minimal damage to medial SMCs. showed a similar increase in replication (1.3% versus 43.3%) after bFGF infusion. In unmanipulated vessels. however. SMCs were unresponsive to infused bFGF. Infusion of a \"mitotoxin\" (bFGF conjugated to saporin) caused a greater than 50% decrease in the number of viable SMCs in the arterial wall after balloon injury. Prolonged administration of bFGF (12 micrograms/day for 2 weeks) after balloon injury caused an approximately twofold increase in intimal thickening. These results show that bFGF. which is synthesized by the arterial wall. could be a potent mitogen for SMCs in vivo and suggest that any release of endogenous bFGF may be capable of stimulating SMC proliferation. which may subsequently lead to intimal lesion formation.',\n",

Key variables affecting thiamin status were controlled. Weekly dietary intakes. subjective feelings. and activity assessments were measured during a 4-week baseline and 6-week double blind treatment period. Clinical assessments were performed during the last week of each period. For treatment. subjects were randomly assigned to either thiamin (10 mg daily) or placebo groups. Compared to baseline and placebo supplemented values. thiamin-supplemented women experienced significantly increased appetite. energy intake. body weight and general well-being. and decreased fatigue. Thiamin supplementation also tended to reduce daytime sleep time. improve sleep patterns. and increase activity. These data suggest that evaluation of thiamin status is indicated when nonspecific conditions such as anorexia. weight loss. fatigue. depression. and sleep disorders are present in elderly persons.',\n",
       " '20, Cyclosporine for plaque-type psoriasis. Results of a multidose, double-blind trial, BACKGROUND. Severe plaque-type psoriasis has been successfully treated with orally administered cyclosporine. but there has been no comparative. controlled evaluation of various dosages and their efficacy and side effects. METHODS. In a 16-week. double-blind trial. we randomly assigned 85 patients with severe psoriasis to receive 3. 5. or 7.5 mg of cyclosporine per kilogram of body weight per day or a placebo consisting of the vehicle for the drug. After eight weeks the dose could be adjusted to improve safety or efficacy while maintaining blinding. RESULTS. The psoriasis improved in a dose-dependent fashion. After eight weeks of fixed-dose therapy. 36. 65. and 80 percent of the patients receiving 3. 5. and 7.5 mg of cyclosporine per kilogram per day. respectively. were rated as being clear or almost clear of psoriasis; each group had significant improvement (P less than 0.0001) as compared with the group receiving vehicle. in which none of the patients were rated as clear or almost clear. The patients who received 5 mg per kilogram were the least likely to require dosage adjustments because of side effects or a lack of efficacy. The glomerular filtration rate. measured in a subgroup of 34 patients receiving cyclosporine. decreased by a median of 16 percent. Higher doses of cyclosporine had greater adverse effects on systolic blood pressure. glomerular filtration rate. and serum levels of creatinine. uric acid. bilirubin. and cholesterol. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to skin-test antigens were reduced by cyclosporine administration. Cyclosporine appears to become concentrated in skin. CONCLUSIONS. Cyclosporine therapy leads to a rapid and thorough clearing of psoriasis; an initial dose of 5 mg per kilogram per day seems to be appropriate. However. the safety of cyclosporine for the long-term treatment of psoriasis remains to be determined.',\n",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sera were obtained from 59 diabetic patients. 44 chronically ill nondiabetic patients. and 34 age-matched healthy control subjects. Mononuclear cells were isolated from a subgroup of diabetic patients and healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Except for a modest increase in the prevalence of detectable serum TNF levels in diabetic patients. the serum cytokines measured in this study did not appear to be altered in diabetes. In vitro TNF production by mononuclear cells was not altered in diabetic patients. However. in vitro IL-1 beta secretion. in response to lipopolysaccharides. was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus is not associated with significant changes in serum levels of TNF. IL-1 alpha. or IL-1 beta. In vitro secretion of IL-1 beta in response to lipopolysaccharides may be reduced in diabetes.',\n",

       " \"20, IL-6 production by human T lymphocytes. Expression in HTLV-1-infected but not in normal T cells, IL-6 is an important regulator of humoral and cellular immunity. Although this cytokine is produced by diverse cell types. it is not known whether it is produced by T lymphocytes under physiologic conditions or which agents can induce T cell expression of IL-6. We analyzed the production of IL-6 by human peripheral blood T cells. human thymocytes. and human T cell lines. In pure populations of these cells. stimulated with different combinations of various mitogens and cytokines. IL-6 activity could not be detected. Analysis of purified T-alpha beta and T-gamma delta cells showed that neither T cell subset produced IL-6. Similarly. IL-6 mRNA was not detected in T cell or thymocyte populations for up to 48 h after stimulation. With the use of a PCR assay. IL-6 mRNA in T cells was found to be virtually negligible. and did not change after T cell activation. By in situ hybridization it was shown that the cells expressing IL-6 mRNA after mitogen activation of PBMC do not belong to the T cell lineage. To analyze whether human T cells express IL-6 in vivo. we examined lymphoid tissues by in situ hybridization. In normal human thymus there was no detectable signal for IL-6. Tonsils showed only few positive cells within the parenchyma. but strong expression of IL-6 by epithelial cells in crypts. In contrast to normal lymph node. which contained only rare cells positive for IL-6. a lymph node from a patient with Castleman's disease showed IL-6 expression in cells occupying the marginal sinus and interfollicular areas. Screening of various human T cell lines showed that all cell lines infected with HTLV-1 secrete IL-6 activity and express IL-6 mRNA. In addition. in vitro infection of peripheral blood T cells with HTLV-1 induced de novo synthesis and secretion of IL-6. Furthermore. IL-6 expression in HTLV-1-infected cells was enhanced by stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha. In contrast. IL-6 was not detectable in non-infected T cell lines. These studies indicate that IL-6 may not be a physiologic product of human T lymphocytes and that infection of T cells with HTLV-1 results in aberrant expression of this cytokine.\",\n",
       " '20, Delayed-type hypersensitivity initiation by early-acting cells that are antigen mismatched or MHC incompatible with late-acting, delayed-type hypersensitivity effector T cells, The elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in mice is mediated by the sequential activities of two different Ag-specific. Thy-1+ cells. A required early phase of elicitation is due to DTH-initiating Thy-1+ cells that are CD3- and sIg- and produce Ag-specific factors that act like IgE antibodies in that they sensitize the tissues. so that after local challenge with Ag there is release of the vasoactive amine serotonin. Released serotonin locally recruits and activates CD4+ Th-1 classical DTH effector T cells that secrete lymphokines that attract and activate a nonspecific perivascular infiltrate of circulating. bone marrow-derived leukocytes. The current study used isolated subpopulations of DTH-initiating and DTH-effector T cells to determine whether the two phases of the elicitation of DTH were entirely separate. The contact sensitivity model of DTH was used. Early-acting DTH-initiating cells. and late-acting DTH-effector T cells were either from oxazolone (OX)-immune or picryl chloride (PCl)-immune CBA or BALB/c donors and were transferred to CBA or BALB/c recipients. The results showed that DTH-initiation could be mediated by polyclonal DTH-initiating cells that were Ag mismatched or MHC incompatible with late-acting DTH effector T cells. In fact DTH-initiating cells could be both Ag mismatched and MHC incompatible with late-acting T cells. In addition. potential interactions between different cell populations were ruled out by showing that DTH-initiation could be mediated by a DTH-initiating clone that was Ag or MHC mismatched with the late-acting DTH-effector T cells. Thus. the OX-specific BALB/c clone could initiate DTH for PCl-specific CBA cells in CBA recipients if the recipients were challenged with both OX and PCl. but not when they were challenged with OX or PCl alone. We suggest. at least for the elicitation of DTH reactions in mice. that a more comprehensive description of these responses should accommodate the fact that there are early and late phase responses that each begin with Ag specificity and end with non-specific humoral factors. Inasmuch as the two Thy-1+ cells of DTH can be of different Ag specificity. this suggests that some forms of delayed and chronic inflammation. might be initiated by an immediate hypersensitivity-like immune reactivity to one set of Ag. and could be prolonged and perpetuated by delayed reactivity to another set of Ag.',\n",
       " '20, Ultraviolet B radiation converts Langerhans cells from immunogenic to tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells. Induction of specific clonal anergy in CD4+ T helper 1 cells, We have recently demonstrated that a single dose (200 J/m2) of UVB radiation abrogates the capacity of mouse epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) or splenic adherent cells (SAC) to present keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to Ag-specific. MHC-restricted CD4+ Th1 cells. In the present study we determined whether such Th1 unresponsiveness represented long-lasting immunologic tolerance. To address this question. Th1 were preincubated with KLH-pulsed UVB-LC or UVB-SAC. then isolated and restimulated with unirradiated APC (LC or SAC) plus KLH or with exogenous rIL-2 in the absence of APC. Preincubation with KLH and UVB-LC or UVB-SAC rendered Th1 unresponsive to subsequent restimulation with APC and KLH. In addition. such Th1 were defective in their autocrine IL-2 production. but could respond normally to exogenous rIL-2. indicating that unresponsiveness was due to functional inactivation and not to cell death. Th1 unresponsiveness was Ag-specific. MHC-restricted. and long lasting (greater than 16 days). In addition. it appears that Th1 unresponsiveness is not due to the release of soluble suppressor factors from UVB-LC or UVB-SAC because supernatants from such cells had no effect on Th1 proliferation. Addition of unirradiated allogeneic SAC during preincubation prevented the induction of unresponsiveness by UVB-LC or UVB-SAC. suggesting that UVB interferes with the capacity of LC or SAC to deliver a costimulatory signal(s) that can be provided by allogeneic SAC.

TNF. or LPS. Each agent stimulated the adhesion to EC of both eosinophils and neutrophils in a similar dose- and time-dependent manner. F(ab')2 fragments of mAb 1.2B6 (anti-endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM)-1) and mAb 6.5B5 (anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1) each inhibited partially. and to a similar extent. eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to EC monolayers prestimulated with TNF (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. Greater inhibition of both eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion was achieved by combining the effects of mAb 1.2B6 with either mAb 6.5B5 or mAb TS1/18 (anti-CD18). These observations indicate that both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 are involved in the adhesion of eosinophils and neutrophils to EC stimulated with TNF. In order to determine whether these molecules are expressed in vivo during allergen-induced late phase allergic responses in the skin. human skin biopsies were examined at 6 h after Ag or saline challenge with the use of an alkaline phosphatase-staining technique. Both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 were expressed with greater intensities in Ag-challenged biopsies. suggesting that these molecules may be involved in granulocyte recruitment in vivo. The similarities we have established between mechanisms of eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to cytokine-stimulated EC suggests that factors other than differential leukocyte-EC adhesion may be responsible for the selective accumulation of eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation.\",\n",
       " \"17, Newly identified U4/U6 snRNP-binding proteins by serum autoantibodies from a patient with systemic sclerosis, We found serum autoantibodies directed against the proteins binding exclusively to U4/U6 of Sm small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) in serum from a patient (MaS) with systemic sclerosis. Their specificity. called anti-MaS. is distinct from that of known antibodies against U snRNP. The U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA from a 32P-labeled HeLa cell extract and five proteins with Mr 150.000. 120.000. 80.000. 36.000. and 34.000. in addition to Sm core proteins (B. B'. D. E. F. and G) from an [35S] methionine-labeled extract. were immunoprecipitated by anti-MaS in isotonic solution. However. the Sm core proteins and U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA were separated from the protein-A-Sepharose facilitated MaS immunoprecipitate by incubation in a solution containing 500 mM NaCl. In immunoblots. anti-MaS antibodies reacted with one protein of Mr 150.000 from a HeLa cell nuclear extract that was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The monospecific immunoaffinity purified antibody eluted from the immunoblot band immunoprecipitated U4 and U6 small nuclear RNA and reblotted the protein with Mr 150.000. These data indicate that anti-MaS antibodies recognize at least one antigenic protein that binds exclusively to the U4/U6 snRNP.\",\n",
       " '22, Parental MHC molecule haplotype expression in (SJL/J x SWR)F1 mice with acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced with two different synthetic peptides of myelin proteolipid protein, To determine if the Ag that induces an autoimmune disease influences parental MHC haplotype molecule expression in situ in MHC heterozygotes. acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced with different encephalitogenic peptides in (SJL/J x SWR)F1 mice. The mice were sensitized with either a synthetic peptide corresponding to mouse myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) residues 103-116 YKTTICGKGLSATV which induces EAE in SWR (H-2q). but not SJL/J (H-2s) mice or a synthetic peptide corresponding to PLP residues 139-151 HCLGKWLGHPDKF which is encephalitogenic in SJL/J but not SWR mice. Mice were killed when they were moribund or at 30 days after sensitization. Twelve of 18 F1 mice given PLP peptide 103-116 and 12 of 17 mice given PLP peptide 139-151 developed EAE within 2 to 3 wk after sensitization. Cryostat sections of brain samples from F1 and parental mice were immunostained with a panel of mAb identifying H-2s and H-2q class I and II MHC molecules. In brains of controls. class I MHC molecules were expressed on choroid plexus. endothelial cells. and microglia whereas class II MHC molecules were absent. In EAE lesions. class I and II MHC molecules were present on inflammatory and parenchymal cells. but the degree of parental haplotype molecule expression did not vary with the different peptide Ag tested. Thus. in (SJL/J x SWR)F1 mice. myelin PLP peptides 103-116 and 139-151 are co-dominant Ag with respect to clinical and histologic disease and parental haplotype MHC molecule expression. We propose a unifying hypothesis consistent with these results and previous observations of differential Ia expression in (responder x non-responder)F1 guinea pigs. We suggest that MHC molecules may bind locally derived peptide Ag in inflammatory sites and that these interactions influence levels of MHC haplotype molecules on APC.',\n",
       " '22, Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. IV. Improved tolerance of immature myocardium to hypoxia and ischemia by intravenous metabolic support, Thirteen immature puppies (2 to 4 kg) underwent 1 hour of acute hypoxia (oxygen tension 25 to 30 mm Hg). followed by 45 minutes of normothermic global ischemia on total vented bypass with normal blood reperfusion. Ventricular function was assessed by inscribing Starling function curves and measuring stroke work indices before hypoxia and after reperfusion. Seven puppies (control) received normal saline infusion at 4 ml/kg/hr. Six other puppies received a 4 ml/kg/hr intravenous infusion of glutamate/aspartate. glucose-insulin-potassium. mercaptopropionyl glycine. carnitine. and catalase during hypoxia and reperfusion. In control hearts. acute hypoxia depleted myocardial glutamate and aspartate by 52% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia) and 48% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia) and caused severe hemodynamic deterioration (55% decrease of stroke work index) (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia); three of seven (43%) required premature institution of bypass. Postischemic left ventricular function recovered to only 40% of control levels (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia). In contrast. intravenous metabolic infusions maintained tissue glutamate (p less than 0.05 versus control group) and aspartate (p less than 0.05 versus control group) in treated hearts during hypoxia and allowed cardiac index to rise 20% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia); all treated hearts tolerated 1 hour of hypoxia. and stroke work recovered 70% (p less than 0.05 versus control group) of stroke work index after subsequent ischemia. Impaired tolerance of immature hearts to acute hypoxia and subsequent ischemia is due to substrate depletion. This impairment can be reduced by intravenous metabolic support during hypoxia and reperfusion and leads to improved recovery of postischemic function.',\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging showed what appeared to be a tumor in the conus medullaris. After laminectomy. the lesion was localized by ultrasound examination. and a biopsy was performed. The deficits remained unchanged postoperatively. Microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen showed necrosis and pathologic changes consistent with infarction of the conus medullaris. An anomalous arterial supply of the conus medullaris is the most likely cause of this unusual problem. The patient gradually regained her ability to walk. but the neurogenic bladder persists.',\n",
       " '23, Unfavorable outcome following early surgical repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms--a critical review of 238 patients, Among 238 consecutive patients admitted early with ruptured cerebral aneurysms. surgical repair within 48-72 hours was feasible in 200 cases. Unfavorable outcomes among the latter 200 patients are analyzed and discussed in this paper. Preoperatively. 148 patients were in Hunt and Hess grades I-III. 33 were in grade IV. and 19 in grade V. After clipping of the aneurysm. all patients received a regimen of topical intracisternal and intravenous/peroral medication with the calcium antagonist nimodipine. The overall rate of unfavorable outcomes was 25%. ie. outcome with moderate or severe deficit or lethal outcome. The reasons for unfavorable outcomes among these 49 patients were the devastating effect of the bleed (severe subarachnoid hemorrhage or additional intracerebral hemorrhage) in 31 patients (15% of the 200 patients). a surgical complication in 11 (5.5%). preoperative rebleeding in three (1.5%). delayed ischemia from vasospasm in one (0.5%). and various others in three further patients (1.5%). Unfavorable outcome occurred in 11% of patients with preoperative grades I-III. in 52% of patients with grade IV. and in 16 of 19 patients with grade V. Among the 141 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage but not intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma. 16 made an unfavorable outcome. ie. 11% versus 56% among patients with intracerebral hematoma/intraventricular hematoma on preoperative computed tomography scan. The present data seem to speak in favor of early surgery. Since half of the patients with intracerebral hematoma and poor outcome had suffered previous warning leaks. it appears to be a continuing challenge to diagnose warning leaks before a massive hemorrhage occurs.',\n",
       " '23, Prostaglandin F1 alpha levels during and after neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, Infants receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy undergo long-term cardiopulmonary bypass. are systemically heparinized. and frequently receive platelet transfusions. Prostacyclin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet aggregation as well as a potent vasodilator. The levels of its stable metabolite prostaglandin F1 alpha increase significantly in children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass during heart operations but decrease to preoperative levels after bypass. To determine the effect of long-term bypass on prostacyclin levels. multiple plasma samples were analyzed in 10 human neonates both during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy and within 24 hours after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Prostaglandin F1 alpha. the stable metabolite of prostacyclin. was quantitated by radioimmunoassay in picograms per milliliter. Prostaglandin F1 alpha levels were elevated while the patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy but decreased with duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In most infants. prostaglandin F1 alpha levels rose again during weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and remained elevated for 24 hours after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation course influenced circulating prostaglandin F1 alpha levels. Fluctuating prostaglandin F1 alpha levels are of clinical significance in the management of vasomotor tone and platelet function. common problems in the care and the prevention of hemorrhage in these critically ill infants.',\n",

       " '22, Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. III. Models of ischemic and hypoxic/ischemic injury in the immature puppy heart, This study compares the metabolic and functional effects of three different models of ischemia in the immature heart. The intent was (1) to develop a model of energy-depleted and functionally depressed heart to be used in subsequent studies of myocardial protection and (2) to characterize the biochemical changes following different interventions. Forty-five minutes of normothermic global ischemia produced severe depletion of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate (greater than 70%) but was associated with 85% +/- 10% recovery of left ventricular function. Postischemic functional depression (less than 30% recovery) could be produced by either (1) extending the ischemic duration to 60 minutes or (2) preceding 45 minutes of ischemia by 60 minutes of hypoxic stress (oxygen tension 25 to 30 mm Hg). Neither of these more severe interventions caused more profound depletion of adenosine triphosphate or creatine phosphate. but hypoxic stress produced marked tissue depletion of glutamate (52%) and aspartate (48%) before aortic clamping. Longer ischemia or preceding hypoxia led to greater myocardial accumulation of lactate (greater than 250 versus 104 mumol/gm dry weight) and succinate (18 versus 11 mumol/gm dry weight) during aortic clamping. p less than 0.05 versus 45 minutes of ischemia) and greater postischemic depression and amino acid (greater than 65% aspartate depletion) and carbohydrate (greater than 50% glycogen depletion) metabolism. p less than 0.05 versus simple ischemia. These findings suggest that more severe ischemic/hypoxic models are needed in immature hearts to produce functional depression. and the biochemical analyses suggest the characteristics of metabolic defects that must be corrected to resuscitate these hearts during surgical correction of congenital defects.',\n",

Interventricular communications were present in 73 patients. and major associated anomalies were present in 17 (tetralogy of Fallot in four. double-outlet right ventricle in two. multiple ventricular septal defects in 11). Five deaths occurred in the hospital (5.7%; 70% confidence limits. 3.2% to 9.7%). A preoperative New York Heart Association class V functional condition was the only incremental risk factor (p = 0.02) for death in the hospital. No patient (0%; 70% confidence limits. 0% to 2.15%) had complete heart block. Actuarial survival rate at 80 months was 81.4%. The only incremental risk factor (p = 0.005) leading to reoperation was a preoperative valve incompetence. Actuarial rate at 80 months for freedom from reoperation was 84.2% in the overall group of patients after repair of atrioventricular septal defect. We conclude that an improvement in survival and success rates should be found when a policy of earlier repair is followed.',\n",
       " '16, Neonatal repair of tetralogy of Fallot with and without pulmonary atresia, Our experience with the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries has confirmed the attainability of excellent results with elective neonatal surgery. Up to this time. we have repaired tetralogy of Fallot during the neonatal period only when symptoms. either severe persistent cyanosis or cyanotic spells. have been present. This review assesses the results of such nonelective neonatal correction of tetralogy between 1973 and 1988. Twenty-seven neonates with either symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot or symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot with valvar pulmonary atresia underwent repair. Mean age at repair was 8 +/- 8.4 days and mean weight was 3.0 +/- 0.7 kg. Unsatisfactory palliative shunts had previously been placed elsewhere in four patients. Twenty-five transannular patches and two conduits were used for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. There were five deaths in the hospital. three of which were due to avoidable technical problems. All deaths occurred in patients with pulmonary artery (Nakata) index less than 150 mm2/m2. One premature child weighing 2.3 kg displayed an absent pulmonary valve-like syndrome after repair and died late of respiratory complications caused by aneurysmal branch pulmonary arteries. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 74%. There was a single rapidly declining hazard phase for death. with the hazard approaching zero at 1 1/2 years after repair. Actuarial freedom from need for reoperation was 76% at 5 years. Postoperative catheterization of 15 long-term survivors showed right ventricular pressure less than 70% systemic in 13 cases. All patients are symptomatically well and functioning in sinus rhythm 1 to 15 years after repair (mean. 5 +/- 4 years). This experience with neonates with symptoms suggests that. if mortality is lower in the absence of symptoms. elective repair of tetralogy of Fallot could be reasonably undertaken during the first months of life.',\n",

       " '23, Factors predictive of results of direct ablative operations for drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia. Analysis of 80 patients, During a 9-year period 80 patients with drug-resistant sustained ventricular tachycardia underwent direct surgical ablation of arrhythmogenic myocardium. Sixty-nine were male (86%) and 11 female (14%). with 1.9 +/- 1.1 (standard deviation) ventricular tachycardia morphologies per patient. The mean number of drugs failed was 3.7 +/- 1.6 per patient. The preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 36.4% +/- 14.4%. Complete preoperative endocardial mapping data (greater than 4 endocardial sites in each ventricular tachycardia) were available for 60 of the 80 patients (75%) and intraoperative endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia was obtained in 37 (46.3%) of the patients. In 17 patients mapped intraoperatively by computer-assisted techniques. complete epicardial and endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia were obtained in 14 patients (82.4%). Overall. 73 of 80 (91.3%) had some mapping data available. Hospital mortality occurred in 10 patients (12.5%) at a mean interval of 13.5 days. range 0 to 62 days. Postoperatively the clinical ventricular tachycardia has not recurred in 65 of 70 surviving patients (92.9%). Nonclinical ventricular tachycardia occurred in another four patients. All nine patients with postoperative ventricular tachycardia responded to drugs. The major factors predictive of hospital mortality were prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (greater than 150 minutes). preoperative ejection fraction less than 31%. and incomplete preoperative mapping. Hospital mortality in patients with an ejection fraction below 31% was significantly associated with a history of amiodarone usage. At 3 years of follow-up. freedom from sudden cardiac death was 95.7%. and 86.7% of patients were free of ventricular tachycardia on no antiarrhythmic drugs. These results suggest that direct ventricular tachycardia operations are an effective form of therapy for patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.',\n",
       " '14, Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. V. Safety of prolonged aortic clamping with hypocalcemic glutamate/aspartate blood cardioplegia, This study tests the hypothesis that multidose. hypocalcemic aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia provides safe and effective protection during prolonged aortic clamping of immature hearts. Of 17 puppies (6 to 8 weeks of age. 3 to 5 kg) placed on vented cardiopulmonary bypass. five were subjected to 60 minutes of 37 degrees C global ischemia without cardioplegic protection and seven underwent 120 minutes of aortic clamping with 4 degrees C multidose aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia ([Ca++] = 0.2 mmol/L). preceded and followed by 37 degrees C blood cardioplegic induction and reperfusion. Five puppies underwent blood cardioplegic perfusion for 10 minutes without intervening ischemia to assess the effect of the cardioplegic solution and the delivery techniques. Left ventricular performance was assessed 30 minutes after bypass was discontinued (Starling function curves). Hearts were studied for high-energy phosphates and tissue amino acids. One hour of normothermic ischemia resulted in profound functional depression. with peak stroke work index only 43% of control (0.7 +/- 0.1 versus 1.7 +/- 0.2 gm x m/kg. p less than 0.05). There was 70% depletion of adenosine triphosphate (7.6 +/- 1 versus control 20.3 +/- 1 mumol/gm dry weight. p less than 0.05) and 75% glutamate loss (6.6 +/- 1 versus control 26.4 +/- 3 mumol/gm. p less than 0.05). In contrast. after 2 hours of aortic clamping with multidose blood cardioplegia preceded and followed by 37 degrees C blood cardioplegia. there was complete recovery of left ventricular function (peak stroke work index 1.6 +/- 0.2 gm x m/kg) and maintenance of adenosine triphosphates. glutamate. and aspartate levels at or above control levels adenosine triphosphate 18 +/- 2 mumol/gm. aspartate 21 +/- 1 versus control 2 mumol/gm. and glutamate 25.4 +/- 2 mumol/gm). Puppy hearts receiving blood cardioplegic perfusion without ischemia had complete recovery of control stroke work index. We conclude that methods of myocardial protection used in adults. with amino acid-enriched. reduced-calcium blood cardioplegia. can be applied safely to the neonatal heart and allow for complete functional and metabolic recovery after prolonged aortic clamping.',\n",
       " '10, Acute tolerance in morphine analgesia: continuous infusion and single injection in rats, This study aimed to determine whether the decline of the analgesic effect of morphine with a continuous infusion or that after a single injection correlates with the changes in brain concentration of morphine. The analgesic effect of morphine and its brain and serum concentrations were determined with a continuous 8-h infusion at a constant rate and after a single subcutaneous injection of the agent. The analgesic effect was determined by measuring the threshold of motor response to noxious stimulation. Brain and serum concentrations of morphine were detected by radioimmunoassay with the use of 125I-labeled morphine. With the constant-rate (4 mg.kg-1.h-1. intravenous) morphine infusion. the peak of analgesia could not be maintained: the increase in the pain threshold at 2 h was 1.003 g and at 8h was 286 g (a decrease in analgesia by 72%. P less than 0.0002). At the same time. the brain morphine concentration tended to increase. to 278 ng/g at 2 h and 329 ng/g at 8 h. After the single morphine injection (6 mg/kg. subcutaneous). recovery from analgesia occurred at a much faster rate than did the decrease in morphine brain concentration; the decrease in pain threshold was 79% at 90 vs. 30 min after the injection (P less than 0.0001). and the corresponding decrease in brain concentration was 28% (NS). The absence of correlation between analgesia and morphine brain concentration both with the constant-rate morphine infusion and after the single injection suggests the development of acute tolerance. which is pharmacodynamic in nature.',\n",
       " '23, Body position changes redistribute lung computed-tomographic density in patients with acute respiratory failure, Ten patients with parenchymal acute respiratory failure (ARF) underwent computed tomography (CT) scans while in the supine and prone positions. At equal levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. the authors measured the changes of CT density in dorsal and ventral basilar lung regions induced by the change of position as well as alterations of gas exchange. The level of venous admixture did not change with body position. The CT scan image of each lung was fractionated into ten levels from dorsal to ventral. each constituting 10% of the lung height. After measuring each lung fraction. the volume. the average CT number. its frequency distribution. and the expected normal value. we computed the lung tissue mass. the excess tissue mass. and the fraction of normally inflated tissue (excess tissue mass = amount of \"tissue.\" which includes edema. cells. and blood in excess of the expected normal value). We also estimated the superimposed hydrostatic pressure on each lung region. We found that the excess lung tissue mass is independent of position. However. in patients in the supine position. lung CT density increased and regional inflation decreased from ventral to dorsal. suggesting progressive deflation of gas-containing alveoli along the gravity gradient. A similar ventral-dorsal deflation pattern occurred within 10 min in patients in the prone position. We conclude that the lung in patients with ARF behaves like an elastic body with a diffusely increased mass; dependent lung regions are compressed by the pressure of overlying structures.',\n",

It is typically an indolent disease comprised of small resting B cells. but frequently develops into a high-grade lymphoma. The t(14; 18) translocates the Bcl-2 gene. generating a deregulated Bcl-2-immunoglobulin fusion gene. Bcl-2 is a novel inner mitochondrial membrane protein that extends the survival of certain cells by blocking programmed cell death. To determine the oncogenic potential of the t(14; 18) translocation. we produced transgenic mice bearing a Bcl-2-immunoglobulin minigene that structurally mimicked the t(14; 18). An indolent follicular hyperplasia in these transgenic mice progressed to a malignant diffuse large-cell lymphoma. The long latency. progression from polyclonal to monoclonal disease. and histological conversion. are all suggestive of secondary changes. Half of the immunoblastic high-grade lymphomas had a rearranged c-myc gene. Our transgenic mice provide an animal model for tumour progression in t(14; 18) lymphoma and show that prolonged B-cell life increases tumour incidence.',\n",

In a double-blinded manner. patients received a fentanyl lollipop (20-25 micrograms/kg) and a placebo oral solution (0.4 ml/kg) (n = 20) or a placebo lollipop and an oral solution (0.4 ml/kg) of meperidine (1.5 mg/kg). diazepam (0.2 mg/kg). and atropine (0.02 mg/kg) (n = 20). The patient's vital signs. systolic and diastolic blood pressures. heart rate. respiratory rate. and oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2). as well as activity and apprehension scores were evaluated and recorded at baseline and at 10-min intervals. The patient's emotional status at the time of parental separation and at induction of anesthesia were also assessed. Side effects and onset of action were observed. After OTFC. onset of sedation was significantly faster than with the oral solution of meperidine. diazepam. and atropine. In both groups there was no significant change in heart rate. Although systolic blood pressure. diastolic blood pressure. and respiratory rate showed statistically significant decreases. these changes were not clinically significant. The child's emotional status at the time of separation from the parents and during induction was similar in both groups. Side effects with OTFC were more frequent: nose itching occurred in 65%. body itching in 10%. and vomiting in 30%. Two patients (10%) in the OTFC-treated group became hypoxemic (SpO2 less than 90) and required supplemental oxygen. In the group receiving oral meperidine. diazepam. and atropine. 10% had mild facial pruritus and 5% complained of a dry mouth.\",\n",

Medetomidine produced a dose-dependent (cumulative doses: 25 and 50 micrograms) sedative effect evaluated by visual analog scale. Also. a dose-dependent decrease of blood pressure but not of heart rate was seen after administration of medetomidine. Pain threshold to electric stimulation of the tooth pulp and cutaneous heat pain threshold were uninfluenced by medetomidine. An index of cutaneous thermal sensitivity to innocuous stimuli. the width of the thermoneutral zone. also was uninfluenced by medetomidine. Medetomidine produced a significant attenuation of the affective-motivational component (unpleasantness) of tourniquet-induced ischemic pain. whereas the sensory-discriminative component (pain magnitude estimate) of the ischemic pain was not attenuated. The results suggest that systemic medetomidine alone at subanesthetic but sedative and hypotensive doses does not significantly influence the intensity and thresholds of experimental pain. whereas the affective-motivational component of pain can be attenuated.',\n",

A prospective regional trial, Prenatal hemoglobinopathy screening was chosen as a model system for the study of patient receptivity to unsolicited genetic information. Providers of prenatal care in Rochester. NY. were offered free testing of all their prenatal patients and genetic counseling of women found positive. The 18.907 prenatal samples tested in a 5-year period represented 35.1% of the pregnancies in the Rochester metropolitan region. A hemoglobinopathy was found in 810 pregnancies (4.3%). Of the 21 different types of hemoglobinopathies detected. the most common were sickle cell trait (59%). hemoglobin C trait (19%). beta-thalassemia trait (11%). and hemoglobin E trait (5%). At the time of phlebotomy. 75% of the pregnancies were of less than 18 wk duration. Sixty-six percent of the pregnancies occurred in patients unaware of their diagnosis. and 80% occurred in patients unaware that they might be at risk for a child with a serious blood disorder.

Of 453 women counseled during their first screened pregnancy. 390 (86%) said they wanted their partners tested and 254 (55%) had their partner tested. In the 77 pregnancies thus found to be at risk. the couple was too late for prenatal diagnosis in 12 cases. and the condition for which the fetus was at risk was too mild in 12 cases. Prenatal diagnosis was offered in the remaining 53 pregnancies and was accepted by 25 couples (47%).

       " \"15, Prenatal screening for hemoglobinopathies. II. Evaluation of counseling, Learning during genetic counseling is often below expectations. especially in the context of genetic screening. In this report we describe learning as a result of genetic counseling of 298 pregnant women identified as hemoglobinopathy carriers. 234 with sickle cell trait and 64 with beta-thalassemia trait. Counseling was designed to provide the information needed in a simple. clear. and nondirective manner. A special videotape produced for this purpose provided dramatization and a role model illustrating an appropriate response. After viewing the videotape the counselee had an opportunity to question the counselor and to have any misconceptions corrected. Questionnaires revealed significantly increased knowledge as a result of counseling in each of the three hemoglobinopathy subject areas tested-namely. clinical manifestations. genetics. and prenatal diagnosis. Five factors correlated with higher knowledge scores after counseling-namely. a younger patient age. more years of education. knowledge of having trait before this identification. knowledge of the baby's father having trait before counseling. and having no prior children.\",\n",
       " '4, Suppression of tumorigenicity in human colon carcinoma cells by introduction of normal chromosome 5 or 18, Development of colon carcinomas can be associated with allelic deletions on several chromosomes. including 5q and 18q. The APC gene on 5q and the DCC gene on 18q have been identified as potential tumour suppressor genes. whose suppression contributes to colon carcinogenesis. To investigate the role of genes in these deleted regions. we have now introduced a single normal human chromosome into a human colon carcinoma cell line. COKFu. through microcell hybridization. Several clones of hybrid cells containing normal chromosome 5. and others containing normal chromosome 18. were obtained. The morphology of the hybrid cells was markedly altered: the hybrids with chromosome 5 exhibited a closely packed polygonal morphology. and the hybrid cells with chromosome 18 were flattened. The cloning efficiency of the hybrid cells in soft agar was reduced from 0.46 to 0% of that of the parental carcinoma cells. and the tumorigenicity of these hybrid cells in athymic nude mice was completely suppressed. The growth properties of the hybrid cells with chromosome 11 were not substantially changed. These results strongly suggest that the genes on normal chromosome 5 and 18 function as tumour suppressors in colon carcinogenesis.',\n",

The CT findings regarding neoplastic invasion of adjacent organs and metastasis or enlarged lymph nodes were compared with the findings at laparotomy (85 cases) or autopsy (5 cases). thus permitting evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of CT and its usefulness for predicting resectability. When present. neoplastic invasion of adjacent organs was overestimated or underestimated by CT in 21 cases. Invasion of adjacent organs according to CT was false positive in 17 cases and false negative in 11 cases. When liver metastasis or enlarged regional or distant lymph nodes were present. CT overestimated or underestimated their extent in 17 cases. and the diagnosis was false positive in one case and false negative in 33 cases. The positive and negative predictive values of CT concerning resectability of the tumor were 81% and 64%. respectively.

Sixty patients were more than 70 years of age and 232 were under 69 years. The incidence of well-differentiated carcinomas and poorly differentiated carcinomas was the same in the elderly patients. whereas the latter was dominant in the young patients. However. there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding location. size. macroscopic patterns. extent of lymph metastases. or stage classification. The rates of preoperative surgical risk factors were significantly different between the two groups (p less than 0.01): 90.0% for the elderly and 34.9% for the young patients.

A new defibrillator lead system that allows selection of different defibrillating current pathways is implanted without a thoracotomy. Ten patients requiring a cardioverter-defibrillator for recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (five patients) or aborted sudden cardiac death (five patients) were evaluated for implantation of this lead system. A lead configuration with a bidirectional defibrillating current pathway was implanted in nine patients. The defibrillation threshold with this lead configuration was 15 J in five patients. 20 J in three and 30 to 35 J in one patient. In the remaining patient the lead system had a 40 J defibrillation threshold and was not implanted. No perioperative complications occurred. Induced ventricular fibrillation was successfully terminated at the predischarge and intermediate follow-up (8 to 12 weeks) electrophysiologic studies. During the follow-up period. there were three deaths (one sudden. two due to heart failure) and two lead system failures (oversensing with inappropriate shocks in one patient and patch lead fracture in another). Implantation of the cardioverter-defibrillator lead system by a nonthoracotomy approach is feasible. has no significant perioperative complications and is well tolerated by patients. Effective defibrillation was demonstrated immediately as well as at intermediate follow-up study. The occurrence of patch lead fracture and oversensing requires improvement in the present (nonthoracotomy) lead system technology.',\n",

Participants had a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and were compared with 55 age-matched normotensive control subjects. Left ventricular mass index was significantly higher in the participants than in the normotensive subjects (103 +/- 28 versus 87 +/- 23 g/m2. p = 0.0014) and 26% of the participants met echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy compared with 10% of normotensive subjects. Left atrial index was also greater in participants than in normotensive subjects (2.26 +/- 0.32 versus 2.11 +/- 0.24 cm/m2. p = 0.005) and 51% of participants had left atrial enlargement.

       " '23, Drug therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias: how many electropharmacologic trials are appropriate, To determine how many electropharmacologic drug trials should be performed to select therapy for patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias. the outcome of 150 consecutive patients with inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias undergoing serial electropharmacologic testing was examined. The probability of identifying predicted effective therapy (inductive of fewer than five ventricular responses with three ventricular extrastimuli at three pacing cycle lengths) and the probability of that therapy preventing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia recurrences were determined as a function of the number of preceding trials. The probability ( +/- SE) of identifying predicted effective therapy by the first trial (0.23 +/- 0.03) was significantly higher than that of the second (0.09 +/- 0.04). third (0.08 +/- 0.04) and fourth (0.05 +/- 0.04) trials (p = 0.001). No patient had predicted effective therapy identified by subsequent trials. The 2 year actuarial probability of freedom from sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias on predicted effective therapy was higher for the first (0.79 +/- 0.08). second (0.73 +/- 0.13) and third (0.86 +/- 0.13) trials than for the fourth (0.33 +/- 0.27) trial (p = 0.02). Thus. the probability of selecting therapy with long-term efficacy was highest for the first trial (0.18). intermediate for the second (0.07) and third (0.07) trials and lowest for the fourth (0.02) and subsequent (0.00) trials. Accordingly. the electropharmacologic approach to therapy selection should be abandoned after three unsuccessful trials.',\n",
       " '14, Comparison of pre- and postoperative conduction patterns in patients surgically cured of atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia, Patients with atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia characteristically have short and constant retrograde His-atrium conduction times (H2A2 intervals) during the introduction of ventricular extrastimuli. It has therefore been suggested that the tachycardia circuit involves retrograde conduction up an accessory pathway located in perinodal tissue. If the mechanism of surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is interruption of this accessory pathway. postoperative changes in retrograde conduction would be expected. Thirteen patients with drug-refractory AV node reentrant tachycardia underwent surgery. Preoperatively. H2A2 intervals were short and constant. During AV node reentrant tachycardia. earliest atrial activation was seen near the His bundle and was 0 to 25 ms before ventricular activation in all patients except one. Surgery consisted of dissection of right atrial septal and anterior inputs to the AV node and central fibrous body. Postoperatively. the H2A2 interval remained short and constant compared with preoperative values although it was slightly prolonged (74 +/- 18 versus 61 +/- 21 ms. p less than 0.005). Twelve of the 13 patients are free of tachycardia after 28 +/- 13 months and no patient has had evidence of AV node block. Thus. surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is highly successful; however. there is no reason to postulate an accessory pathway or use of perinodal tissue as part of the tachycardia circuit and the mechanism of surgical success remains obscure.',\n",

Atrial electrograms were recorded at 12 sites in the right atrium. The duration and number of fragmented deflections of the atrial electrograms were quantitatively measured. The mean duration and number of fragmented deflections of the 516 atrial electrograms in Group I were 74 +/- 11 ms and 3.9 +/- 1.3. respectively. The criteria for an abnormal atrial electrogram were defined as a duration of greater than or equal to 100 ms or eight or more fragmented deflections. or both.

The extent of abnormal left ventricular perfusion was quantified from computer-generated polar maps of three-dimensional myocardial radioactivity. Patients with only a moderate (51% to 69%) stenosis tended to have a small perfusion defect irrespective of the coronary artery involved. Whereas a perfusion defect measuring greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricle was found in 78% of patients with no prior infarction and severe (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis. this was observed in only 24% of patients with moderate stenosis. Perfusion defect size increased with increasing severity of stenosis for the entire group without infarction and for those with left anterior descending. right and circumflex coronary artery stenosis. However. the correlation between stenosis severity and perfusion defect size was at best only modest (r = 0.38. p = 0.0001). The left anterior descending artery was shown to be the most important of the three coronary arteries for providing left ventricular perfusion. Proximal stenosis of this artery produced a perfusion defect approximately twice as large as that found in patients with a proximal right or circumflex artery stenosis. However. marked heterogeneity in perfusion defect size existed among all three vessels despite comparable stenosis severity. This was most apparent for the left anterior descending coronary artery. where mid vessel stenosis commonly produced a perfusion defect similar in size to that found in proximally stenosed vessels.',\n",

The records of 28 patients with melanoma metastatic to the adrenal gland seen since 1975 were reviewed. Eighteen patients were men and 10 were women. Twenty-three patients had unilateral disease. Four patients were diagnosed only at autopsy. leaving 24 for analysis of treatment and survival. Twenty-one patients had received specific active immunotherapy. four had received chemotherapy (dacarbazine. lomustin. bleomycin. and vincristine). and three had received both before the diagnosis of their adrenal disease. Adrenal metastases were diagnosed by CT scanning in 14 patients with symptoms. 10 (91%) of whom had pain. Ten patients were diagnosed by CT before entry into a chemotherapy protocol. Of eight patients who underwent resection of all known disease. five underwent unilateral adrenalectomy. two underwent unilateral adrenalectomy and bowel resection. and one underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. Two patients underwent partial resection of large unilateral tumors. Fourteen patients with adrenal metastases and disease elsewhere were initiated or continued with chemotherapy or were treated symptomatically. Mean survival in the group that underwent resection for cure was 59 months (3 to 112 months). whereas survival in the group with unresectable tumors was 15 months (1.5 to 132 months). Four of eight patients who underwent resection for cure lived more than 5 years after detection of adrenal metastasis. whereas in only one of 14 patients with unresectable tumors was the same true. Patients with metastatic melanoma localized to one or both adrenal glands may benefit from early detection and surgical intervention.',\n",

The origin of left ventricular dysfunction had been previously determined by coronary angiography to be ischemic (11 patients) or nonischemic (10 patients). Images were visually analyzed by three observers on a graded scale in seven left ventricular segments and revealed fewer defects in dilated cardiomyopathy compared with ischemic cardiomyopathy for N-13 ammonia (2.7 +/- 1.6 versus 5 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.03) and F-18 deoxyglucose (2.8 +/- 2.1 versus 4.6 +/- 1.1; p less than 0.03). An index incorporating extent and severity of defects revealed more homogeneity with fewer and less severe defects in subjects with nonischemic than in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy as assessed by imaging of flow (2.8 +/- 1.8 versus 9.2 +/- 3; p less than 0.001) and metabolism (3.8 +/- 3.3 versus 8.5 +/- 3.6; p less than 0.005). Diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing the two subgroups by visual image analysis was 85%. Using previously published circumferential count profile criteria. patients with dilated cardiomyopathy had fewer ischemic segments (0.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.5 +/- 2 per patient; p less than 0.01) and infarcted segments (0.1 +/- 0.3 versus 2.4 +/- 1.4 per patient; p less than 0.001) than did patients with cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease. The sensitivity for differentiating the two clinical subgroups using circumferential profile analysis was 100% and the specificity 80%. An index incorporating both number and severity of defects derived from circumferential profile analysis was significantly lower in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy than in ischemic cardiomyopathy (0.3 +/- 0.8 versus 2.7 +/- 2.4; p less than 0.005). Thus. noninvasive positron emission tomographic imaging with N-13 ammonia and F-18 deoxyglucose is helpful in distinguishing patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease from those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. and a semiquantitative index such as circumferential profile analysis is superior to that of visual analysis alone.',\n",

The age range was 30-80 years. Mean age was 51 years. Follow-up was 1-4 years. Twenty patients underwent decompression and fusion for spinal stenosis. nine underwent spinal arthrodesis for instability. six underwent the same for spondylolisthesis. and five underwent fusions for other diagnoses. A posterior midline approach was used. Laminal hook sites were prepared. and care was taken to prevent dural compression or tenting. Balanced distraction was done to restore soft tissue tension and stability. No attempt was made to reduce deformity. A posterior and lateral mass fusion augmented with allograft bone was performed on all but three patients. in whom autogenous bone was used. The majority of patients were placed in a custom-molded lumbosacral orthosis for 3-6 months after operation. There were no neurologic complications. dural tears. or pseudomeningoceles. The first sacral laminas were instrumented in 22 patients. Nine of the 40 patients underwent rod removal. Reasons for removal were pain due to loosening in five patients and failure of fusion in two. On rod removal in two patients. no abnormality was found. Insertion within the sacral laminas did not lead to neurologic complications. The major problem appeared to be loosening. which necessitated rod removal in 12% of the patients. Knodt rod distraction instrumentation is a safe and effective method of internal fixation for lumbosacral fusions.',\n",

       " '18, Normalization of blood glucose in diabetic rats with phlorizin treatment reverses insulin-resistant glucose transport in adipose cells without restoring glucose transporter gene expression, Evidence is emerging for a direct role of glucose. independent of changes in insulin. in the regulation of cellular glucose transport and glucose utilization in vivo. In this study we investigate potential cellular and molecular mechanisms for this regulatory effect of glucose by determining how normalization of glycemia without insulin therapy in diabetic rats influences 3-O-methylglucose transport and the expression and translocation of two genetically distinct species of glucose transporters (GTs) in adipose cells. These results are compared with alterations in glucose disposal in vivo measured by euglycemic clamp. In rats rendered diabetic by 90% pancreatectomy. insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipose cells is decreased 50% in parallel with reduced insulin-mediated glucose disposal in vivo. Levels of adipose/muscle GTs measured by immunoblotting are decreased in adipose cell subcellular membrane fractions. as are the corresponding mRNA levels assessed by Northern blotting of total adipose cell RNA. Normalization of blood glucose in diabetic rats with phlorizin. which impairs renal tubular glucose reabsorption and thus enhances glucose excretion. restores insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipose cells and insulin-mediated glucose disposal in vivo. Importantly. levels of the adipose/muscle GT protein remain 43% reduced in the low-density microsomes in the basal state and 46% reduced in the plasma membranes in the insulin-stimulated state. Adipose/muscle GT mRNA levels remain approximately 50% depressed. Levels of the HepG2/brain GT protein and mRNA are unaltered by diabetes or phlorizin treatment. Thus. changes in ambient glucose independent of changes in ambient insulin can regulate the glucose transport response to insulin in isolated adipose cells and changes in responsiveness parallel alterations in glucose uptake in vivo. Since this effect can occur without alteration in the expression of the two species of glucose transporters present in adipose cells or in their translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. it may result from changes in GT functional activity.',\n",
       " '18, Role of increased cytosolic free calcium in the pathogenesis of rabbit proximal tubule cell injury and protection by glycine or acidosis, To assess the role of increased cytosolic free calcium (Caf) in the pathogenesis of acute proximal tubule cell injury and the protection afforded by exposure to reduced medium pH or treatment with glycine. fura-2-loaded tubules were studied in suspension and singly in a superfusion system. The Ca2+ ionophore. ionomycin. increased Caf to micromolar levels and rapidly produced lethal cell injury as indicated by loss of lactate dehydrogenase to the medium by suspended tubules and accelerated leak of fura and failure to exclude Trypan blue by superfused tubules. Decreasing medium Ca2+ to 100 nM prevented the ionomycin-induced increases of Caf and the injury. Reducing medium pH from 7.4 to 6.9 or adding 2 mM glycine to the medium also prevented the cell death. but did not prevent the increase of Caf to micromolar levels. Cells treated with 1799. an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation which produced severe adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. did not develop increases of Caf until just before loss of viability. Preventing these increases of Caf with 100 nM Ca2+ medium did not protect 1799-treated cells. Reduced pH and glycine protected 1799-treated cells without ameliorating the increases of Caf. These data demonstrate the toxic potential of increased Caf in the proximal tubule and show that Caf does sharply increase prior to loss of viability in an ATP depletion model of injury. but this increase does not necessarily contribute to the outcome. The potent protective actions of decreased pH and glycine allow the cells to sustain increases of Caf to micromolar levels in spite of severe. accompanying cellular ATP depletion without developing lethal cell injury.',\n",

However. increased catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was reported and could be due to increased availability of peripheral lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or hepatic lipase (HL). In this study plasma lipoproteins and postheparin activities of LPL and HL were determined in 12 patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia before and during isocaloric substitution of omega-3 fatty acids (10 g/d) for 4 wk. Omega-3 polyunsaturates resulted in 53% and 61% reductions in plasma triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations. respectively (P less than 0.0001). However. low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations increased by 26% (P less than 0.001). Activities of postheparin LPL and HL essentially remained the same. Thus. in patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia. reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations and increase in LDL-cholesterol concentrations mediated by omega-3 polyunsaturates seem to occur without an increase in LPL or HL activities.',\n",

In both groups fecal lipid consisted almost completely (greater than 90%) of free fatty acids. whose composition was highly correlated with the corresponding formula's fatty acid composition [r = 0.96 (lard modified) and r = 0.99 (standard)]. Both groups had similar relative amounts and compositions of fecal cholesterol esters and triglycerides. Plasma and. to a lesser extent. erythrocyte membrane long-chain-fatty-acid compositions correlated with those of the corresponding formulas. We suggest that the extensive intestinal hydrolysis and limited absorption of dietary lipids is. at least partly. due to lipolysis in the colon. Appearance of triglycerides in the colon may be due to a rapid small-intestinal passage in relation to small-intestinal lipolysis.\",\n",

       " '23, Peripheral arterial occlusive disease: prospective comparison of MR angiography and color duplex US with conventional angiography, Conventional angiography. two-dimensional inflow magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. and color duplex ultrasound (US) were performed on 12 patients in a blinded. prospective study. The ability to grade arterial lesions and plan revascularization interventions were compared. Arterial lesions were categorized as nonsignificant (0%-49% diameter reduction) or significant (50%-100% diameter reduction). Determination of nonsignificant and significant lesions with MR angiography was in agreement with that at conventional angiography in 100 of 140 lesions (71%). Agreement between results of conventional angiography and color duplex US occurred with 114 of 123 infrainguinal lesions (93%). Twenty-one vascular interventions were planned by using conventional angiography; there was agreement with color duplex US in 11 cases and MR angiography in five. Color duplex US performed well in the assessment of infrainguinal disease but was limited in the evaluation of iliac segments because of nonvisualization. The iliac region was visualized in more patients with MR angiography than with color duplex US. but image quality with MR angiography was inconsistent. Strategies to improve MR angiography of the peripheral vasculature merit further study.',\n",

Previously. we have shown that IL-2-PE40. a chimeric protein composed of human IL-2 linked to the N-terminus of a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). could effectively kill a variety of cell lines in vitro expressing either low. intermediate. or high affinity IL-2R. Here. we demonstrate that IL-2-PE40 can successfully retard or prevent the growth of a lethal ascites tumor or a solid tumor composed of EL4J murine thymoma cells transfected with the p55 murine IL-2R. The transfected line. EL4J-3.4. expresses 1.000 to 3.000 high affinity IL-2R. Survival extension in the ascites model was achieved by initiating treatment either after 4 to 6 h or within 5 days post-tumor injection in both athymic nude and C57BL/6 mice. Similarly. the growth of an aggressive s.c. solid tumor could also be inhibited. Extension of survival was not achieved either by using the truncated toxin alone not attached to IL-2 or by using an IL-2-PE40Asp553 mutant lacking a functional toxin. Survival extension was not caused by IL-2 activated NK or other host effector mechanisms as IL-2-PE40 was unable to prevent the receptor-negative EL4J parental line from forming a lethal ascites or a solid tumor. Thus. IL-2-PE40 is a potent. specific cytolytic reagent that may prove useful in the arsenal of anti-IL-2R immunotherapeutics.',\n",

       " '23, Expression and characterization of TCA3: a murine inflammatory protein, TCA3 is a cDNA originally isolated from activated T cells. Transcription of this gene has been shown to correlate with Ag-induced cellular activation of both T cells and mast cells. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA. we previously proposed that TCA3 represents a cytokine. In this report we have used rDNA technology to express TCA3 in two mammalian cell lines. In both cases. TCA3 was expressed as a secreted molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa. Digestion of the (rTCA3) with the enzyme N-glycanase revealed that approximately 8 kDa is caused by N-linked glycosylation. Intradermal injection of rTCA3 into mouse footpads resulted in a rapid swelling response. The sites of injection were characterized histologically by a local accumulation of neutrophils. These findings are discussed with particular attention to a family of related proteins. some of whose members also have inflammatory properties.',\n",

In each case. the referring physician's specialty and his findings on cardiac physical examination were recorded. All patients had M-mode echocardiography. and half of the patients had two-dimensional echocardiography. Sensitivities. specificities. and likelihood ratios for the physical examination were calculated using echocardiography as the comparison standard. The combination of a systolic click and a systolic murmur was the physical examination finding most predictive of echocardiographic MVP. with a positive likelihood ratio of 2.43. Other combinations of physical findings yielded likelihood ratios close to 1. No differences were found based on the specialty of the examining physician. We conclude that when practicing physicians find a systolic click and murmur. MVP is likely to be present on echocardiography. though one third of the patients will have normal echocardiograms. Other combinations of physical findings are of little help in predicting echocardiographic MVP.\",\n",
       " '17, Evidence that cutaneous antigen-presenting cells migrate to regional lymph nodes during contact sensitization, These studies address the hypothesis that Ag-bearing epidermal Langerhans cells migrate to the regional lymph node during contact sensitization and function as APC. Skin from C3H mice was grafted onto BALB/c nude mice. and 7 or 14 days later. the recipients were sensitized with FITC through the grafts. APC from lymph nodes draining the site of sensitization were capable of sensitizing C3H recipients to FITC. Because sensitization is MHC restricted. only cells reaching the lymph node from the grafted skin could have induced contact hypersensitivity in C3H mice. Examination of the FITC+ draining lymph node cells by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that all were Ia+. most were F4/80+. and some contained Birbeck granules. These studies demonstrate that Ia+. FITC+ cells from the skin. at least some of which are Langerhans cells. leave the skin after epicutaneous sensitization with FITC and participate in the initiation of the contact hypersensitivity response within the regional lymph node.',\n",

Specimens from 18 patients with cerebellar hemangioblastomas were immunohistochemically studied using anti-EPO monoclonal antibody. Eight cases of brain tumors. including 2 meningiomas. 2 medulloblastomas. 2 glioblastomas. and 2 metastatic brain tumors were studied as controls. In 9 of 18 cases. EPO-positive cells were scattered around the capillaries and were ultrastructurally shown to be mast cells. These cases were not. however. associated with secondary polycythemia. In contrast. the stromal cells were positive for EPO in 3 cases. Among them. one was associated with secondary polycythemia. Furthermore. one-half of the control cases of brain tumor contained EPO-positive mast cells. Accordingly. it was suggested that mast cells (or small granulocytes) have little relationship to the release of EPO; however. some stromal cells might release EPO with a resultant polycythemia.',\n",

The trial involved surgical resection and/or decompression followed by intracavitary implantation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and autologous stimulated lymphocytes (ASL) along with rIL-2 in a plasma clot. One month later. stimulated lymphocytes and rIL-2 were infused through a Rickham reservoir attached to a catheter directed into the tumor bed. The LAK cells were rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 4 days; the ASL were lectin- and rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 10 days. Of the 20 patients treated. 11 were evaluated as a group (mean age. 44 years. range. 15-61 years; mean Karnofsky rating. 69. range. 50-100; mean Decadron dose at entry. 14 mg/d. range. 0-32).

These tumors usually occur in the pineal. parasellar. or suprasellar regions several years after the successful treatment of ocular retinoblastomas with no evidence of direct extension or distant metastasis. We report here a case of ectopic retinoblastoma occurring within the third ventricle. The tumor was surgically excised by the transventricular approach. Ectopic retinoblastomas exhibit greater differentiation than one would expect to observe in a metastatic lesion of this tumor. The distinction of ectopic retinoblastomas and metastasis from ocular retinoblastomas is important. since ectopic retinoblastomas. unlike metastasis. can be successfully managed by intensive therapy including radical excision.',\n",

Ninety-two of these patients underwent a procedure for CSF drainage (cisternal drainage. ventricular drainage. lumbar drainage. or a combination of these). The duration. the total volume. and the average daily volume of CSF drainage were 10.4 +/- 7.0 days (mean +/- SD). 2034 +/- 1566 ml. and 190 +/- 65.3 ml. respectively. Patients with a greater drainage volume at a lower height of drainage in the early period after SAH developed more cerebral infarctions later (P less than 0.025). The relationship between the total volume of CSF removed and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus was determined to be statistically significant (P less than 0.005). Cerebral infarction and hydrocephalus after SAH were also found to be statistically associated (P less than 0.001). Thus. continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage should not be performed too readily in patients with SAH. because the removal of a large amount of CSF can induce cerebral vasospasm as well as hydrocephalus.',\n",

Fourteen animals were divided into two groups: a clot group (8) and a sham-operated group (6). To induce subarachnoid hemorrhage. all the animals underwent craniectomy. and in the clot group. the autologous blood clot was located around the arteries dissected free from the arachnoid membrane. Cerebral angiography was performed before subarachnoid hemorrhage and 7 days after (Day 7). On Day 7. regional CBF in the parietal lobe--measured by the hydrogen clearance method--and central conduction time were studied during either graded hypertension or hypotension. In the clot group. the mean vessel caliber of the cerebral arteries on the right side (clot side) of the circle of Willis showed significant (P less than 0.01) reduction (more than 40%) as compared with the values on the contralateral. non-clot side. The values for the bilateral parietal CBF in the sham-operated group and the left parietal CBF in the clot group were fairly constant when the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was in the range of 60 to 160 mm Hg. In the clot group. right parietal CBF was significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that on the left side at an MABP level of 40 to 100 mm Hg. and increased at an MABP level of 180 mm Hg. The right parietal CBF increased as the arterial blood pressure increased. showing impairment of autoregulation.',\n",

Several lines of experimentation have suggested a free radical mechanism in the etiology of vasospasm. Iron is an important catalyst in the generation of free radicals and lipid peroxides in response to tissue injury. We hypothesize that the elaboration of iron from the subarachnoid clot might result in enhanced generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. If so. then treatment with deferoxamine. an iron-chelating compound. might reduce the formation of free radicals and thereby ameliorate vasospasm. This hypothesis was examined in a rabbit model of experimental cerebral vasospasm. New Zealand White rabbits were divided into the following experimental groups: control (normal) animals (n = 7). control animals treated with deferoxamine (n = 3). animals subjected to SAH and killed on Day 2 (n = 7). animals subjected to SAH on Day 2 and treated with deferoxamine (n = 9). animals subjected to SAH killed on Day 3 (n = 7). and animals subjected to SAH on Day 3 and treated with deferoxamine (n = 7). Deferoxamine treatment (50 mg/kg/8 hours) was begun 16 hours before the induction of SAH and continued until the animals were killed by perfusion fixation. The basilar artery caliber was assessed using morphometric techniques. The diameter of the basilar arteries in the control animals was 0.64 +/- 0.02 mm. Deferoxamine treatment alone did not alter the artery diameter.',\n",

In six of the specimen knees. further anatomic studies of the intercondylar notch were performed after tissue removal. The average intercondylar distance was 16.1 mm in Group 1. 18.1 mm in Group 2. and 20.4 mm in Group 3. All differences were highly significant. The intercondylar notch was wider in the posterior part and had no crossing bony ridges but had generally concave walls. which provided a functional shelf for the ACL to insert on the lateral side. Significant osteophyte formation and stenosis of the anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch occur early in the ACL-deficient knee. A narrow anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch without osteophytes was also found in knees with an acute ACL rupture. At reconstruction of the ACL. notchplasty should be performed concomitantly.',\n",

From July 1985 to April 1989 during a 45-month period. 87 patients with 90 articular Colles' fractures (three cases with bilateral involvement) were treated with a modified dynamic external skeletal device after a closed reduction in full supination of the forearm. Excellent anatomic reduction near 91% of the sound wrist as well as satisfactory functional results around 90.5% of the sound wrist were gained during the 24-month follow-up period. Forearm muscles exert compression forces on distal radial metaphyseal fractures throughout the healing period. Any procedure or device that cannot provide constant counterforce to the action of forearm muscles during fracture healing will result in the loss of anatomic reduction. Adequate distraction counter-force was provided by an external fixation device that was superior to other conventional methods because of its simple application. low rate of complications. and excellent anatomic and functional results.\",\n",

We modified the distal corner of the anastomosis as follows: three additional interrupted simple sutures were made on the anterior wall of the concomitant arteriotomy and venotomy incisions after making the common posterior wall of the vessel incisions. A vascular pocket formed at the distal corner of the anastomosis prevents stricture at the anastomosis. The vein is finally ligated just distal to the fistula to intercept downward blood flow into the distal veins. This modification in technique is recommended to prevent stricture of the distal anastomosis and postoperative stasis symptoms.',\n",

The regurgitant volume per beat (VTR) is calculated using two-dimensional color Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographies. In a study of 48 patients. preoperative VTR showed a significant correlation with tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole. right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to preoperative VTR: Group I. VTR less than 10 cc (no. 18); Group II. VTR = 10-20 cc (no. 18); Group III. VTR greater than or equal to 20 cc (no. 12). This classification correlated well with the intraoperative findings of TR. In all Group I patients. VTR decreased without any tricuspid valve repair. In Group II. 17 of 18 patients underwent tricuspid annuloplasty. and showed a decrease in VTR to below 10 cc after surgery. In Group III. 10 underwent tricuspid annuloplasty and 2 tricuspid valve replacement. Three of the 10 with tricuspid annuloplasty showed a significant degree of postoperative VTR (10-20 cc). These 3 patients as well as the 2 with tricuspid valve replacement showed a preoperative peak-to-peak pressure difference across the tricuspid valve during the ejection phase (RVsp-TAv) of less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole of greater than or equal to 50 mm. In conclusion. no tricuspid valve repair was required in Group I (TR I). For group II (TR II) patients. tricuspid annuloplasty was necessary and adequate for TR correction. For Group II (TR III) patients. a more substantial procedure like tricuspid valve replacement should be performed. especially when the preoperative RVsp-RAv is less than or equal to 20 mmHg and tricuspid annular diameter at end-diastole is greater than or equal to 50 mm.',\n",
       " '14, Preoperative evaluation and surgical treatment for tricuspid regurgitation associated with acquired valvular heart disease. The Kay-Boyd method vs the Carpentier-Edwards ring method, This study compared the results of annuloplastic repair of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) using Doppler echocardiography. Sixty-three patients who underwent tricuspid annuloplasty were studied. Thirty-four patients received Kay-Boyd annuloplasty and 29 Carpentier-Edwards ring annuloplasty. A new classification of TR based on the direction and area of regurgitation flow on Doppler echocardiogram was applied preoperatively. In the Kay-Boyd group. 10 cases showed massive TR and 24 cases showed localized TR preoperatively. Localized TR was well controlled in all cases. but 8 of 9 cases of massive TR showed grade III residual TR. In the C-E group. 21 cases showed massive TR and 8 cases showed localized TR. All cases were well controlled postoperatively. We conclude that (1) although the Kay-Boyd method is acceptable for localized TR. the C-E method should be employed for massive TR; (2) analyzing the regurgitant pattern of TR by Doppler echocardiogram is useful in selecting an appropriate surgical technique.',\n",

To investigate the possibility of a sex hormone abnormality in this condition. we have compared a range of sex hormones during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in 23 healthy women (mean age 33 years) with those in 26 patients with severe idiopathic constipation (mean age 32 years. spontaneous bowel frequency less than one per week). In the patients there was a reduction in the follicular phase of progesterone (4.5 v 4 nmol/l. p = 0.006. median value. controls v patients). 17 hydroxyprogesterone (9.7 v 5.8 nmol/l. p = 0.01). cortisol (387 v 245 nmol/l. p = 0.008). testosterone (2.3 v 1.8 nmol/l. p less than 0.001). androstenedione (10.3 v 8.4 nmol/l. p = 0.02). and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (5.1 v 3.0 mumol/l. p = 0.03). In the luteal phase there was a reduction of oestradiol (483 v 350 pmol/l. p = 0.015). cortisol (322 v 242 nmol/l. p = 0.047). and testosterone (2.4 v 1.7 nmol/l. p = 0.003).

We found an association with current alcohol and cigarette consumption. The risk of polyps was increased three times in drinkers who did not smoke and two times in smokers who did not drink. with those who both drank and smoked having 12 times the risk of total abstainers. Since colonic adenomatous polyps are generally regarded as premalignant lesions. these results lend support to the view that alcohol consumption may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia. thus reinforcing the proposed polyp/carcinoma sequence in colorectal carcinogenesis. The role of smoking. however. is less clear particularly since the lack of association of colorectal carcinoma and smoking has been reported in many other studies.',\n",
       " '18, Modulation of coronary vasomotor tone in humans. Progressive endothelial dysfunction with different early stages of coronary atherosclerosis, The endothelium plays a critical role in the control of vasomotor tone by the release of vasoactive substances. Because endothelial injury or dysfunction is considered important very early in atherogenesis. we hypothesized that abnormal endothelial function precedes the angiographic detection of coronary atherosclerosis in the human coronary circulation. The coronary vasomotor responses to three different endothelium-mediated stimuli (intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine 10(-8) to 10(-6) M. increase in blood flow to induce flow-dependent dilation. and sympathetic stimulation by cold pressor testing) were assessed by quantitative angiography and subselective intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements within the left anterior descending coronary artery in 38 patients. All three stimuli elicited epicardial artery dilation in all 11 patients with smooth coronary arteries and absence of risk factors for coronary artery disease (group 1). All nine patients with smooth coronary arteries but with hypercholesterolemia (group 2) demonstrated a selective impairment in endothelial function with vasoconstriction (35 +/- 12.7% decrease in mean luminal area) in response to acetylcholine but showed a preserved flow-dependent dilation (15.5 +/- 4.4% increase in mean luminal area) and vasodilation in response to cold pressor testing (14.2 +/- 4.6% increase in mean luminal area). In all nine patients with an angiographically defined smooth coronary artery segment but with evidence of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the coronary system (group 3). both acetylcholine and cold pressor testing induced vasoconstriction (26.2 +/- 8.7% and 18.7 +/- 7.9% decrease in mean luminal area. respectively). whereas flow-dependent dilation was preserved (20.4 +/- 8.7% increase in mean luminal area). In the nine patients with angiographic evidence of wall irregularities (group 4). flow-dependent dilation was also abolished and vasoconstriction occurred in response to acetylcholine and cold pressor testing (34.5 +/- 10.7% and 19.9 +/- 6.3% decrease in mean luminal area. respectively). All coronary artery segments dilated in response to nitroglycerin. suggesting preserved function of vascular smooth muscle. Despite similar reductions in coronary vascular resistance in response to the smooth muscle relaxant papaverin. patients with hypercholesterolemia demonstrated a selective impairment of vasodilation of the resistance vasculature in response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.05 versus groups 1. 3. and 4). Thus. there is a progressive impairment of endothelial vasoactive functioning in coronary arteries of patients with different early stages of atherosclerosis. beginning with a selective endothelial dysfunction in angiographically defined normal arteries in patients with hypercholesterolemia and progressively worsening to a complete loss of endothelium-mediated vasodilation in angiographically defined atherosclerotic coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).',\n",
       " '23, Endothelium-dependent responses in long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts, In the present study. responses of long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) to known endothelium-dependent vasodilators. acetylcholine. calcium ionophore A23187. thrombin. and histamine. as well as authentic nitric oxide. the putative endothelium-derived relaxing factor. were studied. Sixteen CAGBs were isolated within 1-2 hours from hearts of 14 patients receiving a cardiac transplant. A total of 109 ring segments were prepared from these CABGs and studied in vitro. The duration of the CABGs ranged from 7 months to 12 years. Addition of acetylcholine (0.01-10 microM). calcium ionophore A23187 (0.01-1.0 microM). thrombin (0.01-1.0 unit/ml). and histamine (0.01-1.0 microM) consistently produced a dose- and endothelium-dependent relaxation. reaching a maximum of -35.3 +/- 3.3%. -45.3 +/- 5.5%. -26.9 +/- 4.8%. and -17.8 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- SEM). respectively. No significant difference was observed among the CABGs with different duration of transplantation. whereas the relaxant responses of different segments along the entire length of a CABG were markedly different. These latter differences in the endothelium-dependent responses appear to correlate inversely with the development of intimal proliferative lesions in these CABGs. Addition of nitric oxide (0.01-10 microM) produced a potent dose- and endothelium-independent relaxation. which was also slightly depressed in CABGs with severe intimal proliferation. These results demonstrate that long-term transplanted human saphenous vein grafts retain their endothelium-dependent responses and that development of severe intimal proliferative lesions. rather than the duration of the grafts. result in marked alterations in the reactivity of these transplanted CABGs.',\n",
       " '14, Accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in detecting physiologically significant coronary arterial lesions, The accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary artery stenosis has been assessed previously by comparing the exercise test with a coronary arteriogram. The inherent inaccuracy of visually determined percent diameter stenosis measurements might have lead to the conclusion that the exercise electrocardiogram was less accurate than it truly was. To determine the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary stenosis. we studied 40 patients with one-vessel. one-lesion coronary artery disease. a normal resting electrocardiogram. and no hypertrophy or prior infarction. Each patient underwent exercise electrocardiography (Bruce protocol) that was interpreted as abnormal if the ST segment developed 0.1-mV or greater depression 80 msec after the J point. The physiological significance of each coronary stenosis was assessed by measuring of coronary flow reserve (peak divided by resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery using a Doppler catheter and intracoronary papaverine (normal. 3.5 or greater peak/resting velocity). The percent diameter and percent area stenosis produced by each lesion were determined using quantitative angiography (Brown/Dodge method). Of the 17 patients with reduced coronary flow reserve (3.5 or greater peak/resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery. 14 had an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram (sensitivity. 0.82; 95% confidence interval. 0.70-0.94). Conversely. 20 of 23 patients with normal coronary flow reserves had normal exercise tests (specificity. 0.87; 95% confidence interval. 0.77-0.97). The exercise electrocardiogram was abnormal in each of 11 patients with markedly reduced coronary flow reserve (less than 2.5 peak/resting velocity) and in three of six patients with moderately reduced reserve (2.5-3.4 peak/resting velocity). The products of systolic blood pressure and heart rate at peak exercise were significantly correlated with coronary reserve in patients with truly abnormal exercise tests. In comparison. the sensitivity (0.61; 95% confidence interval. 0.46-0.76) and specificity (0.73; 95% confidence interval. 0.60-0.86) of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a 60% or greater diameter stenosis may be significantly lower (p less than 0.05). Exercise electrocardiography. therefore. was a good predictor of the physiological significance (assessed by coronary flow reserve) of a coronary stenosis in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram and no hypertrophy or prior infarction. Its value in a broader and larger patient population will require further study. These results. however. underscore the importance of a physiological gold standard in assessing the accuracy of noninvasive studies for detecting coronary artery disease.',\n",

She required repeated blood transfusions that were complicated by reactions and still had persistent anaemia. She was treated with laser phototherapy in the form of quadrantic photocoagulation with a neodynium yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser. This greatly improved the endoscopic appearance of the gastric lesions and effectively controlled blood loss. She required no further transfusions.

Working Party of the Clinical Services Committee of the British Society of Gastroenterology, (1) The number of endoscopic examinations performed is rising. Epidemiological data and the workload of well developed units show that annual requirements per head of population are approaching: Upper gastrointestinal 1 in 100 Flexible sigmoidoscopy 1 in 500 Colonoscopy 1 in 500 ERCP 1 in 2000 (2) Open access endoscopy to general practitioners is desirable and increasingly sought. For a district general hospital serving a population of 250.000. this workload entails about 3500 procedures annually. performed during 10 half day routine sessions plus emergency work. (3) High standards of training and experience are needed by all staff. who must work in purpose built accommodation designed to promote efficient and safe practice. (4) The endoscopy unit should be adjacent to day care facilities and near the x ray department. There should be easy access to wards. (5) An endoscopy unit needs at least two endoscopy rooms; a fully ventilated cleaning/disinfection area; rooms for patient reception. preparation. and recovery; and accommodation for administration. storage. and staff amenities. (6) The service should be consultant based. At least 10 clinical sessions are required. made up of six or more consultant sessions and two to four clinical assistant. hospital practitioner. or staff specialist sessions. Each consultant should be expected to commit at least two sessions weekly to endoscopy. Extra consultant sessions may be needed to provide an efficient service. (7) A specially trained nursing sister (grade G or H) and five other endoscopy nurses are needed to care for the patients; their work may be supplemented by care assistants. (8) A new post of endoscopy department assistant (analogous to an operating department assistant) is proposed to maintain and prepare instruments. and to give technical assistance during procedures. (9) A full time secretary should be employed. Records. appointments. and audit should be computer based. (10) ERCP needs the collaboration of an interventional radiologist working with high quality x ray equipment in a specially prepared radiology screening room. This facility may need to serve more than one hospital. (11) A gastrointestinal measurement laboratory can conveniently be combined with the endoscopy unit. In some hospitals one or more gastrointestinal measurement technicians may staff this laboratory. (12) An endoscopy unit is a service department analogous to a radiology department. It needs an annual budget.',\n",

Comparison with 4,315 men, We determined in-hospital and 1-year prognoses after acute myocardial infarction (MI) in 5.839 consecutive patients derived from 14 of 21 coronary care units in Israel during 1981-1983. Age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was 23.1% in 1.524 women and 15.7% in 4.315 men (p less than 0.0005). One-year age-adjusted mortality rates in patients surviving hospitalization were 11.8% in women and 9.3% in men (p = 0.03). Cumulative age-adjusted 1-year mortality rates were 31.8% in women and 23.1% in men (p less than 0.0005). Relative odds of mortality. covariate-adjusted for major prognostic factors that included age. prior MI. congestive heart failure. and infarct location by electrocardiogram. indicated that female gender was independently and significantly associated with increased mortality both during hospitalization (relative odds. 1.72; 95% confidence interval. 1.45-2.04) and at 1 year after discharge (relative odds. 1.32; 95% confidence interval. 1.05-1.66). In separate multivariate analyses for each gender. a major factor that emerged as a predictor of outcome in women. but not in men. was a reported history of diabetes mellitus. both for in-hospital mortality and for 1-year mortality. However. even in the nondiabetics in this population. female gender was a significant. independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. The findings of the present study substantiate that women fare worse than men after suffering an acute MI. that increased age does not fully account for the increased mortality in women. and that diabetic women are at particularly high risk once MI has occurred.',\n",
       " '14, Secular trends in Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction. The Minnesota Heart Survey, The Minnesota Heart Survey examined trends of Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using a 50% random sample of all hospital discharges of patients with AMI or another acute coronary disease from 35 of 36 hospitals in 1970 and 30 of 31 hospitals in 1980 in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. A total of 1.901 and 1.864 potential AMI cases were abstracted in 1970 and 1980. respectively. Electrocardiograms were coded according to the Minnesota code. AMIs were validated by computerized algorithm based on chest pain. enzymes. electrocardiograms. and autopsy. This study shows that with the use of a consistent. standard diagnostic algorithm. attack rates for Q wave AMI did not change significantly between 1970 and 1980 and that attack rates for non-Q wave AMI decreased significantly during the same decade. However. when the more sensitive cardiac enzymes creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphokinase-MB were considered. attack rates of both Q wave and non-Q wave AMIs increased. This research documents four important trends for community AMI rates that are at variance with those reported by others. There was a decline in non-Q wave AMI attack rates from 1970 to 1980; women had outcomes equal to or worse than those for men for both case-fatality and 7-year survival rates; patients with non-Q wave AMIs had worse in-hospital prognoses than those with Q wave AMIs; and 7-year survival rates were worse for Q wave AMI in 1980. These findings demonstrate the need for standard diagnostic criteria for Q wave and non-Q wave AMI if trends are to be monitored. In the future. as new trials of operative and nonoperative therapies of AMI are undertaken. these considerations will increase in importance.',\n",
       " '14, Prevention of hypertension and vascular changes by captopril treatment, Treatment of female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with captopril was carried out by the addition of the drug in the drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation and after weaning. At 28 weeks of age. average systolic blood pressure of treated SHR was 113 +/- 3 mm Hg. which was below that of control SHR (188 +/- 3 mm Hg) and WKY rats (124 +/- 3 mm Hg). Body weight and heart rate of the SHR were not affected by the treatment. Tissue level of catecholamines was increased by captopril treatment in the superior cervical ganglia but remained unchanged in the plasma. heart. mesenteric arteries. and the adrenal glands of both SHR and WKY rats. Left ventricular weight. wall thickness. and internal diameter of the left ventricle in the SHR were reduced by the treatment. Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that vascular alterations present in the control SHR were prevented by the treatment. In the superior mesenteric artery and large mesenteric artery. smaller lumen size at maximal relaxation found in the control SHR was normalized to the level of the WKY rats. Hypertrophy of the medial wall in the superior mesenteric. large and small mesenteric arteries. and an increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large mesenteric artery of the SHR were prevented by the treatment. Perfusion study of the mesenteric vascular bed showed that reactivity of these vessels to norepinephrine was reduced. and sensitivity to norepinephrine (as determined by the effective dose that causes 50% of maximal response) was increased in the SHR by captopril treatment. Sensitivity of the tail artery in response to norepinephrine was not altered by the treatment. We conclude that long-term treatment with captopril of SHR before and after birth prevented the development of hypertension. structural and functional alterations of the mesenteric arteries. and cardiac hypertrophy.',\n",

The concentration-time data were best represented by a three-compartment model. The peak plasma concentration. plasma clearance. and elimination half-life ranged from 249 +/- 80 to 227 +/- 110 ng/ml. 268 +/- 70 to 329 +/- 58 l/h. and 29 +/- 25 to 118 +/- 119 h. respectively. in groups 1 and 2. In group 1. trough concentration increased progressively (linear regression: y = 4.4x; r = .91. P = .001) without achieving steady state. and the renal clearance-to-plasma clearance ratio was 2.1% +/- 0.01%. In group 3. the elimination half-life after the last dose was 12.0 +/- 2.3 days. The elimination half-life of pentamidine was long and accumulation occurred with daily dosing even in patients with normal renal function. Dose adjustment is not recommended for renal impairment as renal clearance accounts for a small fraction (2.1%) of plasma clearance.',\n",

NIAID Collaborative Antiviral Study Group, Using the decision analysis technique and multivariate regression methods. a statistical model was established to define the utility of brain biopsy for diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). Two strategies were compared: strategy I. brain biopsy with acyclovir (ACV) treatment for 10 days in biopsy-positive patients. and strategy II. ACV therapy without brain biopsy. Strategy I resulted in a greater 6-month survival rate when the likelihood of patients having HSE was less than 70%. Based on the current estimated prevalence of HSE (for patients with suspected HSE) of 35%. strategy I showed a slight advantage of a 3.2% increase in 6-month survival rate. An individual patient's chance of a positive brain biopsy can be predicted using a mathematical equation based on several important clinical assessments. This equation in conjunction with the decision analysis is a useful guide for the clinical management of patients with regard to brain biopsy.\",\n",

Of 130 measles cases reported between April and June 1988. 119 (92%) constituted a study of disease severity. Severity was assessed by determining frequency and duration of symptoms. length of any hospitalization. and number of days in bed. In a univariate analysis. fewer secondary cases had conjunctivitis (relative risk [RR]. 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 0.48-0.96) and headache (RR. 0.37; CI. 0.15-0.86). but more had earache (RR. 9.69; CI. 1.8-202.9) compared with primary cases. Secondary cases had a shorter mean duration of coryza (4.0 vs. 5.0 days. Student's t test. P = .08). However. a logistic regression model that matched by family and controlled for age and sex indicated that there were no significant differences in measles severity among primary and secondary cases in households.\",\n",
       " '1, Immunization of mice with antibiotic-treated Escherichia coli results in enhanced protection against challenge with homologous and heterologous bacteria, The murine immune response to Escherichia coli exposed to subminimal inhibitory concentrations of four antibiotics was investigated. Groups of mice were injected for 8 weeks with formalin-killed bacteria and subsequently challenged with 10 x LD50 of viable E. coli. Mice receiving saline only (controls) died within 24 h. The mortality of mice immunized with ciprofloxacin-treated E. coli was significantly lower than that of mice immunized with E. coli untreated or treated with other antibiotics. Sera from mice immunized with ciprofloxacin-treated bacteria showed better bacteriostatic capacity and enhanced production of antibodies that bound to homologous and heterologous lipopolysaccharide isolated from several smooth and rough gram-negative strains. The better protection observed in mice immunized with ciprofloxacin-treated E. coli was probably due to an enhanced production of antibodies to epitopes on lipopolysaccharide that became better exposed and so more accessible after treatment with ciprofloxacin.',\n",

Antigens recognized by sera from individuals with culture-confirmed pertussis and by sera from infants immunized with three doses of conventional whole-cell pertussis vaccine included a 63.000-Da protein that was shown to be antigenically related to a mycobacterial heat-shock protein. A 29.000-Da protein reacted with sera from convalescent individuals. whereas a 91.000-Da protein reacted with sera from vaccinated individuals. Antibodies to adenylate cyclase toxin were common in sera from individuals diagnosed with pertussis. B. pertussis lipooligosaccharide was also recognized by antibodies in some of these sera. These data suggest that some of these antigens may play a role in immunity to pertussis.',\n",

This study compared autografts and allografts with respect to the time required and the success of graft incorporation. Fifty-four patients with 61 lesions were studied. Lesions were classified as small volume (less than 60 cc) or large volume (more than 60 cc) and were separated into four groups: small-volume autograft. large-volume autograft. small-volume allograft. and large-volume allograft. Allografts appeared comparable to autografts when small-volume lesions were treated. The healing time was slightly longer for allografts with an average period of 21 months versus 27 months for autografts. Autografts were superior to allografts in rate and completeness of healing for solitary large lesions. This increased efficacy presumes a somewhat older child in which an adequate amount of bone is available for an autograft.

The primers used were derived from the HTLV-I gag. env and tax genes. Amplified products were separated on agarose gels. blotted onto nylon membranes and hybridized to specific radiolabelled oligonucleotides. The sensitivity of amplification and hybridization was one copy of target DNA in 10(5) cellular genomes. None of the specimens was positive for HTLV-I sequences except the TSP probe. These negative data are all the more significant because brain material from MS patients was used in these studies. Our studies thus fail to support speculations that HTLV-I is involved in the aetiology of multiple sclerosis.',\n",

Data from 1152 patients. fairly representative of the myasthenic population seeking medical advice. were analysed for diagnostic criteria. clinical aspects and therapeutic approaches. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The disease was correctly diagnosed within 2 years of the onset in 80% of cases. Onset of symptoms peaked in the second and third decade in females and fell between 20 and 59 years in males. At first observation 87% of the patients had generalized MG. Maximal worsening was observed within 3 years in 77% of patients. At the last follow-up. 35% of cases were symptom-free (pharmacological remission 24%. remission without treatment 11%). The more severe the disease at the first observation and at the maximal worsening of symptoms. the lower was the proportion of remissions. Steroids were given in 54% and immunosuppressants in 18%. Thymectomy was performed in 72%. mostly in women. younger than age 40. and with generalized MG. Thymectomy seemed to improve the course of the disease. mostly in patients operated on shortly after diagnosis and those with generalized mild-to-moderate disease and with a normally involuted thymus.

From 1980 to 1988. the incidence of cerebral septic embolus was 42% (n = 45) among 106 patients with endocarditis who underwent valve replacement at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Of these 45 patients. 69% (n = 31) had symptomatic cerebral septic infarctions and 31% (n = 14) were asymptomatic. Findings on cerebral computed tomographic scans included ischemic infarcts (n = 36. 80%). hemorrhagic infarcts (n = 5. 11%). normal studies (n = 2. 4%). and unknown (n = 2. 4%). Neurological complications after valve replacement included postoperative strokes (n = 6. 6%). cerebral abscesses (n = 2. 2%). and seizure (n = 1. 1%). The presence of a hemorrhagic infarct preoperatively predisposed to a perioperative stroke (p less than 0.05). In conclusion. cerebral septic infarctions. both symptomatic and asymptomatic. are common among patients with endocarditis referred for valvar operation. In the absence of a hemorrhagic infarct. valve replacement can be performed with minimal risk of a perioperative stroke.',\n",

Operation was radical resection in 87.5% of the patients. subtotal resection with residual tumor in 8.7%. and simple biopsy in 3.7%. A tumor relapse was observed in 24 patients (10%): 2 (1.5%) of 133 with encapsulated thymomas and 22 (20.4%) of 108 with invasive thymomas; among these patients. a relapse was found in 20.6% of the patients who received radiotherapy postoperatively and in 24.6% who did not. Adverse prognostic factors were clinical stage IVa (multiple pleural nodes). not feasible resection (for technical reasons). inoperable tumor relapse. and association with one of the following autoimmune diseases: pure red cell aplasia. hypogammaglobulinemia. and lupus erythematosus. Conversely. myasthenia gravis is now a curable disease; it contributes to early discovery of associated thymoma. thus allowing a better survival for patients with thymoma who have myasthenia gravis compared with patients with thymoma but without myasthenia gravis (p less than 0.05).

Its effects on blood pressure (BP). heart rate. metabolic functions and renal hormones were analyzed after administration of a single oral morning dose in a 3-phase fashion when administered to 17 patients (11 women. 6 men. 21 to 59 years) with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension. After titrating the antihypertensive effective dose biweekly from 1 to 8 mg/day and a mean end titration-point dose of 4.14 +/- 0.1 mg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at week 8 of treatment. it was adjusted to maintain diastolic BP at levels less than or equal to 90 mm Hg for up to 12 weeks of treatment when. at a final mean dose of 4.35 +/- 0.2 mg/day.

Twelve patients with intact AV conduction and AV sequential pacemakers underwent radionuclide studies at rest and Doppler echocardiographic studies at rest and during submaximal exercise. comparing atrial demand pacing (AAI) to sequential AV sensing pacing (DDD) and ventricular demand pacing (VVI). Studies at rest were performed at a constant heart rate between pacing modes. and the exercise study was performed at a constant heart rate and work load. Cardiac output was higher during AAI than during both DDD and VVI (6.2 +/- 1 vs 5.6 +/- 1 and 5.3 +/- 1 liters/min. p less than 0.05). LV ejection fraction was likewise higher during AAI (55 +/- 12 vs 49 +/- 11 vs 51 +/- 13. p less than 0.05). VVI with or without AV synchrony was associated with a paradoxical septal motion pattern. resulting in a 25% impairment of regional septal ejection fraction. In addition.

       " '23, Pathophysiologic changes in the critically ill patient: risk factors for ulceration and altered drug metabolism, Virtually all patients who are under the physiologic stress of an intensive care unit (ICU) are vulnerable to stress-related mucosal damage and ulceration. Although clinically significant hemorrhage from stress ulceration occurs in only 5-20 percent of patients in the ICU. the associated mortality is greater than 50 percent. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of stress ulcer are not well understood; however. a number of risk factors such as intraluminal gastric acidity and mucosal ischemia have been implicated. To prevent the development of stress ulcers and subsequent complications. it is important to identify and correct these underlying risk factors. Improving mucosal blood flow (i.e.. fluid resuscitation and low-dose dopamine) and providing adequate nutritional support are invaluable adjuncts in minimizing the risk of stress ulcer formation. The use of pharmacologic prophylaxis controls the gastric acidity and prevents the formation of stress ulcers. The potential for drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions are of particular concern in the care of critically ill patients. Multiple organ system dysfunction or failure. malnutrition. fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. as well as the use of multiple pharmacologic agents predispose these patients to alterations in drug pharmacokinetics. drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. These changes may alter the pharmacodynamic response to therapy and must be considered when designing drug dosage regimens for critically ill patients.',\n",
       " '14, Interpreting results of exercise studies after acute myocardial infarction altered by thrombolytic therapy, coronary angioplasty or bypass, Numerous studies have assessed the ability of exercise modalities to predict patient outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Implicit in the use of these prior data to assess the prognosis of patients currently undergoing exercise studies is the assumption that patients selected for exercise assessment are similar over time and that the data generated in the past are therefore applicable to the current patient populations. This study retrospectively assessed the clinical. exercise. and rest and exercise radionuclide angiographic data in 791 consecutive patients referred for exercise radionuclide angiography within 1 month after AMI during a 5-year period to determine if the clinical and exercise characteristics of patients referred for exercise evaluation after infarction have changed significantly over time. Most parameters examined demonstrated significant increasing trends. including thrombolytic therapy at the time of AMI. revascularization procedure between AMI and exercise assessment. age. beta-blocker usage. Q-wave AMI. inferior infarction. exercise double product. exercise capacity. significant ST-segment depression with exercise. peak ejection fraction. and change in ejection fraction with exercise. These data indicate that the characteristics of patients selected to undergo exercise after AMI in a large referral center have changed significantly over time. If these data are applicable to other referral centers and to other exercise testing modalities. previously published results regarding exercise assessment after AMI will need to be reconfirmed in patients currently selected for testing. since these results may no longer be applicable in this current era of aggressive medical and interventional management.',\n",

The goals of treatment for patients with ARDS are to provide supportive therapy. to reverse the underlying etiology or pathology. and to prevent subsequent complications. Supportive therapy consists of supplemental oxygen. positive end-expiratory pressure. and. often. mechanical ventilation. The reversal of the underlying pathology varies according to the etiologic origin of ARDS. Complications from ARDS include stress ulcers. which occur when gastric aggressive and defensive functions become unbalanced. Antacids and cytoprotective agents are used for stress ulcer prophylaxis. but histamine H2-receptor antagonists are now regarded as the standard of care. Because all the marketed H2-receptor antagonists are efficacious. choice of the agent is based on the adverse effect profile and drug interactions. No definitive data currently exist linking stress ulcer prophylaxis regimens that raise intragastric pH to a significant risk for nosocomial pneumonia.',\n",

After baseline exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic ST-segment monitoring. patients received either nifedipine (mean dose. 80 mg/day) or placebo administered 4 times per day. with the initial dose taken immediately upon arising in the morning. Patients were maintained on a stable dose of each study drug for 7 days. after which they underwent repeat exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. During exercise treadmill testing. greater exercise duration was achieved by patients receiving nifedipine than by those receiving placebo (421 +/- 121 vs 353 +/- 155 seconds. respectively; p less than 0.05). Time to greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression was significantly greater with nifedipine (282 +/- 146 seconds) than at baseline (130 +/- 72 seconds. p less than 0.003) and with placebo (150 +/- 98 seconds. p less than 0.0005). During ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. nifedipine reduced both the total number of ischemic episodes (18 vs 54 at baseline and 63 with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both) and the total duration of ischemia (260 vs 874 at baseline and 927 minutes with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both). The surge of ischemia between 06:00 and 12:00 noted at baseline and during placebo therapy was nearly abolished during nifedipine treatment.

Psychological stress was assessed using the 20-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 1 to 2 days before hospital discharge. Once discharged. patients in the treatment group responded to the GHQ by telephone on a monthly basis and. when they reported high levels of stress symptoms (GHQ greater than or equal to 5). received visits from nurses to help them deal with their life problems. Control patients received routine medical care after discharge. Post-hoc subgroup analyses based on life-table methods showed that. for patients receiving routine care after discharge. high stress (GHQ greater than or equal to 5) was associated with a close to threefold increase in risk of cardiac mortality over 5 years (p = 0.0003) and an approximately 1.5-fold increase in risk of reinfarction over the same period (p = 0.09).

Results of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction using a custom-designed catheter with a large. 3-mm-long distal electrode. 2-mm interelectrode spacing. and a shaft with increased torsional rigidity were compared with those using a standard quadripolar electrode catheter (Bard EP). An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied unmodulated radiofrequency current at 550 kHz. which was applied between the distal electrode of the ablation catheter and a large skin electrode. With use of the modified catheter. 12 of 13 patients (92%) had persistent complete AV block induced with 7 +/- 5 applications of 18 +/- 6 W of radiofrequency power. In contrast. complete AV block was produced in only 9 of 18 (50%) historical control patients treated with the standard catheter. despite a similar number of applications (7 +/- 5) and power output (16 +/- 4 W).

While these are relevant in that they assess the technical success of the procedure and the lessening of monaural disability. they do not necessarily assess whether the patient has benefited. This is determined by many factors. not least of which is the hearing in the nonoperated ear. In this paper. we suggest that preoperative and postoperative plots of the air-conduction thresholds in both ears be used as an additional method of presenting the results. First. the proportion of patients that fall into each of three main preoperative impairment groups are identified. This is important. as the potential benefits from surgery are not the same in each group. Thereafter. the percentages of patients that achieve various postoperative hearing categories can be calculated. allowing surgeons to audit their results and make comparisons between series.',\n",

Exogenous copies of wild-type RB have been shown to suppress the tumorigenicity of several types of tumor cells with endogenous RB mutations. including a previously described human prostatic carcinoma cell line. To further support a role for RB inactivation in the genesis of prostate cancer. seven primary or metastatic prostate carcinoma specimens were examined for evidence of RB mutation. By the use of immunoblot analysis and immunostaining of histologic sections. RB-encoded protein was readily detected in tumor cells of five specimens. was equivocally detected in one specimen. and was apparently absent from tumor cells of one specimen. RB mutations in the latter case were precisely characterized as (i) a deletion of 103 nucleotides containing transcriptional start sites and (ii) loss of the second RB allele. The 103-base-pair deletion was sufficient to abolish the promoter activity of upstream DNA sequences in a heterologous expression system. These results (i) demonstrate that RB can be inactivated in vivo by mutation of its promoter. (ii) confirm the existence of RB mutations in some human prostate carcinomas. and (iii) suggest the use of immunohistochemical methods to screen for RB mutations in clinical samples of common adult neoplasms.',\n",
       " '2, Evidence for susceptibility of intrathymic T-cell precursors and their progeny carrying T-cell antigen receptor phenotypes TCR alpha beta + and TCR gamma delta + to human immunodeficiency virus infection: a mechanism for CD4+ (T4) lymphocyte depletion, Individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) demonstrate progressive depletion and qualitative dysfunction of the helper T4 (CD4+) cell population. Mechanisms proposed for attrition of CD4+ T cells include direct cytopathicity of these mature cells following infection as well as infection of early T-lymphocyte progenitors. The latter mechanism could lead to failure to regenerate mature functioning CD4+ T cells. The present study determines the susceptibility of thymocytes at various stages of maturity to infection with HIV-1. Various normal thymocyte populations were inoculated with HIV-1. including unfractionated (UF). CD3- CD4- CD8- [\"triple negative\" (TN)]. CD4+ CD8+ [\"double positive\" (DP)] thymocytes. and thymocyte populations obtained by limited dilution cloning. Cultures were studied for the presence of HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction in addition to examination for reverse transcriptase activity. We determined that transformed T-cell and thymocyte cell lines completely lacking CD4 were not susceptible to infection by HIV-1. whereas all of the following lines were: UF thymocytes (70-90% CD4hi+); DP thymocytes (99% CD4hi+); TN thymocytes (0% CD4hi+); and TCR alpha beta +. TCR gamma delta +. or CD16+ CD3- (natural killer) thymocyte clones expressing variable levels of CD4 and representing the progeny of TN thymocytes. [TCR alpha beta + and TCR gamma delta + refer to the chains of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). and CD4hi refers to a strong rightward shift (greater than 30 linear channels) of the CD4 curve on flow cytometric analysis compared with control.] Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD4 (T4a epitope) but not to CD3 (T3) were capable of blocking infection of mature and immature CD4hi+ thymocytes. Moreover. anti-CD4(T4a) mAbs also inhibited infection of CD4hi- TN thymocytes. indicating that these T-cell precursors--despite their apparent \"triple negativity\" (CD3- CD4hi- CD8-)--expressed sufficient CD4 molecules to become infected. Cell sorter analysis with a panel of CD4 mAbs demonstrated a mean shift of the mean fluorescence channel (MFC) with CD4 mAbs on TN thymocytes of 6 +/- 4 MFC units. Thus. intrathymic T-cell precursors and their progeny representing many stages of T-cell ontogeny are susceptible to infection by HIV-1. including early TN thymocytes. which express very low levels of CD4. Infection of multiple stages and multiple subsets of the T-cell lineage in man. mediated via the CD4 molecule. may explain the inability of the T-cell pool to regenerate in the setting of progressive HIV infection.',\n",

A 122-base-pair region in the 3' region is conserved among the three GRO genes. and a part of it is also conserved in the Chinese hamster genome. suggesting a role in regulation. DNA hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and partial sequence analysis of the genomic clones confirm that the three forms are derived from related but different genes. Only one chromosomal locus has been identified. at 4q21. by using a GRO alpha cDNA clone that hybridized to all three genes. Expression studies reveal tissue-specific regulation as well as regulation by specific inducing agents. including interleukin 1. tumor necrosis factor. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. and lipopolysaccharide.\",\n",
       " '4, Loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 17 and 18 in breast carcinoma: two additional regions identified, The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific regions of the human genome in tumor DNA is recognized as evidence for a tumor-suppressor gene located within the corresponding region of the homologous chromosome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a panel of primary human breast tumor DNAs has led to the identification of two additional regions on chromosomes 17q and 18q that frequently are affected by LOH. Deletions of each of these regions have a significant correlation with clinical parameters that are associated with aggressive breast carcinomas. Previous restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of this panel of tumors has uncovered several other frequently occurring mutations. LOH on chromosome 18q frequently occurs in tumors with concomitant LOH of loci on chromosomes 17p and 11p. Similarly. tumors having LOH on 17q also have LOH on chromosomes 1p and 3p. This suggests that certain combinations of mutations may collaborate in the development and malignant progression of breast carcinomas.',\n",
       " '5, Surgical treatment of scoliosis in a spinal muscular atrophy population, Seventy-eight patients were diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy between 1969 and 1988. Scoliosis developed in 34 of these patients. an incidence of 60%. Thirty-one patients could be retrospectively reviewed by chart review or interview. The average follow-up was 11.5 years. Onset of scoliosis averaged 8.8 years. Twenty-two patients were treated nonsurgically and nine surgically. Patients had improved sitting balance and endurance after surgery. Complications of surgery included loss of correction in one patient. one pseudarthrosis. and one patient who required prolonged ventilatory support. The prolonged survival of patients with spinal muscular atrophy justifies aggressive orthopaedic management of scoliosis to prevent progression of deformity and improve sitting comfort.',\n",
       " '10, Anticonvulsant and behavioral effects of two novel competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonists, CGP 37849 and CGP 39551, in the kindling model of epilepsy. Comparison with MK-801 and carbamazepine, The orally active competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists CGP 37849 (DL-[E]-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid) and its ethyl ester CGP 39551 were evaluated in amygdala-kindled rats. a model for complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures. Anticonvulsant and behavioral effects of these novel compounds were compared with those of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10.11-dihydroxy-5H-dibenzo(a.d)cyclohepten-5.10-imin e] and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine. one of the major drugs for treatment of partial and generalized seizures in humans. For comparative evaluation. the compounds were injected i.p. at the following doses: 1 to 10 mg/kg (CGP 37849 or CGP 39551). 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg (MK-801) and 20 to 40 mg/kg (carbamazepine). respectively. In contrast to carbamazepine. CGP 37849. CGP 39551 and MK-801 exerted only weak anticonvulsant effects in fully kindled rats and did not increase the focal seizure threshold. The weak anticonvulsant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats were associated with profound untoward behavioral effects. The behavioral syndrome induced by the NMDA receptor antagonists in kindled rats was characterized by marked ataxia. hyperactivity and. in case of CGP 37849 and MK-801. stereotypies. such as head weaving. The low or absent effectiveness of the novel NMDA receptor antagonists against kindled seizures suggests that these compounds will not be clinically useful antiepileptics against partial and secondarily generalized seizures. Furthermore. in view of the recent clinical findings on psychotomimetic effects of MK-801 in epileptic patients. the similarities in the excitatory effects produced by CGP 39551. CGP 37849 and MK-801 in kindled rats may indicate that competitive NMDA receptor antagonists may also produce psychotomimetic effects in humans.',\n",
       " '15, Clinical and biologic effects of granulocyte colony stimulating factor in the treatment of myelokathexis, Successful treatment of a patient with myelokathexis. a rare form of chronic neutropenia associated with recurrent infections. is described. Rapid mobilization of bone marrow neutrophils and improved myeloid morphologic features were observed after treatment with human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Transient thrombocytopenia and bone pain were observed during treatment. Although neutrophil chemotaxis. superoxide production. and FcRIII surface expression were reduced. the patient improved clinically after restoration of a normal neutrophil count.',\n",
       " '2, Community-acquired influenza C virus infection in children, To clarify the epidemiologic and clinical features of community-acquired influenza C infection in children. we took specimens throughout the year from a larger number of patients with acute respiratory illnesses in a pediatric clinic in Yamagata. Japan. During a 2-year survey. 20 strains of influenza C virus were isolated from 13.426 specimens. These isolates were recovered throughout the year. The ages of patients with influenza C virus isolates ranged from 2 months to 11 years and peaked at the age of 1 year. The clinical diagnosis of patients with influenza C virus infection included bronchitis in one child and pneumonia in four. Community-acquired influenza C infection in children can cause a variety of respiratory illnesses that cannot be clinically differentiated from those caused by other viruses.',\n",
       " '18, Hypomagnesemia and the parathyroid hormone-vitamin D endocrine system in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: effects of magnesium administration, Because insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with altered electrolyte metabolism and a derangement of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D endocrine system. we studied 23 children with diabetes (age 9.4 +/- 2.5 years) and found lower serum values for total and ionized calcium. magnesium. intact PTH. calcitriol. and osteocalcin than in age- and sex-matched control subjects. All patients were given magnesium orally (6 mg/kg daily of elemental magnesium) for up to 60 days. During treatment. serum magnesium. total and ionized calcium. intact PTH. calcitriol. and osteocalcin concentrations significantly increased. reaching control values. After a 3-day low-calcium diet. the patients had a significantly reduced delta-increment of PTH and calcitriol in comparison with values obtained during hypomagnesemia. After magnesium repletion. the delta-increments of both PTH and calcitriol. in response to the low-calcium diet. were not significantly different from control values. These data suggest that magnesium deficiency plays a pivotal role in altering mineral homeostasis in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.',\n",
       " '4, Dose dependency of time of onset of radiation-induced growth hormone deficiency, Growth hormone (GH) secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycemia was assessed on 133 occasions in 82 survivors of childhood malignant disease. All had received cranial irradiation with a dose range to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of 27 to 47.5 Gy (estimated by a schedule of 16 fractions over 3 weeks) and had been tested on one or more occasions between 0.2 and 18.9 years after treatment. Results of one third of the GH tests were defined as normal (GH peak response. greater than 15 mU/L) within the first 5 years. in comparison with 16% after 5 years. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that dose (p = 0.007) and time from irradiation (p = 0.03). but not age at therapy. had a significant influence on peak GH responses. The late incidence of GH deficiency was similar over the whole dose range (4 of 26 GH test results normal for less than 30 Gy and 4 of 25 normal for greater than or equal to 30 Gy after 5 years). but the speed of onset over the first years was dependent on dose. We conclude that the requirement for GH replacement therapy and the timing of its introduction will be influenced by the dose of irradiation received by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.',\n",
       " '16, Decreased mortality rate among small premature infants treated at birth with a single dose of synthetic surfactant: a multicenter controlled trial. American Exosurf Pediatric Study Group 1, To determine whether a single prophylactic dose of synthetic surfactant would reduce mortality and morbidity rates. we performed a randomized. controlled trial of Exosurf Neonatal at 19 hospitals in the United States. The Exosurf preparation (5 ml/kg) was instilled into the endotracheal tube of premature infants weighing 700 to 1100 gm during mechanical ventilation. as soon as practical after birth. Control infants were treated with air (5 ml/kg). Dose administration was performed in secrecy by clinicians who did not reveal for 2 years what they had instilled. A total of 222 infants received air and 224 received the synthetic surfactant; 36 infants with congenital pneumonia or malformations were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. By the age of 28 days. there were 44 deaths in the air group and 27 deaths in the surfactant group (p = 0.022). By the age of 1 year after term there were 61 deaths in the air group and 35 deaths in the surfactant group (p = 0.002). Although there was no reduction in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. a significant reduction in the number of deaths attributed to respiratory distress syndrome. a significant reduction in the incidence of pulmonary air leaks. and significantly lower requirements for oxygen and mean airway pressure indicated that lung disease was less severe in the Exosurf-treated infants. There were no significant differences in the incidence of complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. intraventricular hemorrhage. patent ductus arteriosus. necrotizing enterocolitis. and infection. The results indicate that a single prophylactic dose of Exosurf. in high-risk premature infants treated soon after birth. reduces the number of deaths from respiratory distress syndrome and the overall mortality rate.',\n",
       " '23, Dexamethasone in the prevention of postextubation stridor in children, To assess whether there is any advantage in the use of corticosteroid to prevent postextubation stridor in children. we conducted a prospective. randomized. double-blind trial of dexamethasone versus saline solution. The patients were evaluated and then randomly selected to receive either dexamethasone or saline solution according to a stratification based on risk factors for postextubation stridor: age. duration of intubation. upper airway trauma. circulatory compromise. and tracheitis. Dexamethasone. 0.5 mg/kg. was given every 6 hours for a total of six doses beginning 6 to 12 hours before and continuing after endotracheal extubation in a pediatric intensive care setting. There was no statistical difference in incidence of postextubation stridor in the two groups; 23 of 77 children in the placebo group and 16 of 76 in the dexamethasone group had stridor requiring therapy (p = 0.21). We conclude that the routine use of corticosteroids for the prevention of postextubation stridor during uncomplicated pediatric intensive care airway management is unwarranted.',\n",
